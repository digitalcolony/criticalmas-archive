I got this recipe idea from my friend Sue in Portland. Turns out chicken hearts are loaded with that miracle nutrient Co-enzyme Q10 (aka Co Q 10). According to the Wikipedia, it is really good for [heart health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10#Supplementation_benefits) (yours, not the chicken). :) ![cut-onions](./img/cut-onions.jpg) ![cut-apples](./img/cut-apples.jpg) ![bacon](./img/bacon.jpg) ![chicken-hearts](./img/chicken-hearts.jpg) ![chicken-hearts-bacon](./img/chicken-hearts-bacon1.jpg) Chicken hearts taste like a milder version of chicken livers, which is why adding the apples and bacon helps round out the flavor.

Looks like balut. I'd rather have some of that dog food meatloaf you made a while back.
