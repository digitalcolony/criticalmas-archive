Today _The 4-Hour Body_ was released on Amazon and other book stores. I happened to be near a Barnes & Noble, so I stopped in to scan the book. This is my initial impression.

![The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416CwiZ96sL.jpg) The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman by Timothy Ferriss is a beast of a book. It is really a textbook. After scanning the book for more than 10 minutes, I came to the conclusion that Tim Ferriss and I are on similar paths and we each draw from many of the same mentors.

Some ideas that popped out in the book and his recent [podcast interview](http://robbwolf.com/2010/12/14/the-paleo-solution-episode-58-tim-ferriss-edition/):

-   Paleolithic and cyclical ketogenic diet. I've been all over the paleo diet and have been planning on starting a cyclical ketogenic diet on December 22nd (start of winter).
-   Cold Weather training. [You know I like that.](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/cold-weather-training/)
-   Alignment exercises with props to Peter Egoscue. I've been a fan of Egoscue exercises for almost 10 years.
-   Tim likes Pavel's training method. This is the 5 rep protocol I started in 2001. I met Pavel in 2004.
-   In the podcast he brought up Charles Poliquin in reference to fixing a shoulder injury. I've been reading Poliquin since the mid 1990s and credit him with being the lead on [sleeping in a completely dark environmen](/2010/06/carbohydrates-blue-light-and-willpower/)t for enhanced performance.

My early review is this book is going to be awesome. Tim Ferriss has earned my trust. I look forward to reading this book and trying some new experiments.

Just bought the book today per your recommendation.  I am sure I will like it, even if I don't I am sure it will make a great doorstop.
