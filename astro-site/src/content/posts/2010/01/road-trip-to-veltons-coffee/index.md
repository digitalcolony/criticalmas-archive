Monday I got a chance to head up with Jason Simon of _Caffeinated Consersations_ to Everett, Washington to visit _Velton's Coffee Roasting Company_. Besides enjoying good espresso and good conversation, we discussed setting up a future Meetup and coffee roasting demo for the _Coffee Club of Seattle_. If you are in the Seattle area and this type of event is of interest to you, join the [Coffee Club of Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-coffee-club/).
