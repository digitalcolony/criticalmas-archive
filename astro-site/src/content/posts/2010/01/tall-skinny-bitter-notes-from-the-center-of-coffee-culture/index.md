I moved to Seattle in August 2007 and from the moment I hit the ground, I started my espresso quest. Since then I've been to many great coffee shops and met many great people. Although I loved my random journey, I would have loved to had this book in my hands when I arrived.

![Tall Skinny Bitter: Notes from the Center of Coffee Culture](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51U8TUtCCNL.jpg) _Tall Skinny Bitter: Notes from the Center of Coffee Culture is by Dani Cone and Chris Munson_. This beautifully designed book takes the reader around Seattle and Portland coffee shops. It provides history and background on the coffee scene with a sense of humor. It is a quick read, but I learned quite a bit.

After reading this book, I realized that I've gotten into a rut. The coffee shop exploring that I used to do weekly has since been replaced by visiting places that I already know are outstanding. This book gave me a few leads on places that I either dismissed or was completely unaware they even existed.

If you are a coffee drinker in Seattle, Portland, or points in between, _Tall Skinny Bitter: Notes from the Center of Coffee Culture_ is an enjoyable reference to our coffee scene.

I have a very tall, sarcastic friend who replaced all of the water in his body with coffee.  I am glad that the book sounds so good and I will make sure all of my coffee friends are aware of it, but the real question of the day has got to be this -- Where can I get that Apron?  My friend must have it!!!

I'm very jealous that you have so many coffee shops that there could be a book about it. However, I am starting to learn about more and more of the ones in my region. Not so much my area.
