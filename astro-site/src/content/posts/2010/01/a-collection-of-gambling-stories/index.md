Because I loved the [Amarillo Slim book](/2007/09/amarillo-slim-the-worlds-greatest-gambler/), Amazon recommended that I might like this one as well.

![The Man With the $100,000 Breasts](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5110TQuCs%2BL.jpg) _The Man With the $100,000 Breasts is by Michael Konik_. The best gambling story in the book is one referenced in the title, which I, unfortunately, was already familiar with. This book was more informative than entertaining. I learned quite a bit about craps, poker, sports betting, and Vegas.

As a person who has never gambled a single dollar in a casino\* or even bought a lottery ticket, I am probably not the target reader. Gamblers, especially poker players, would probably enjoy this book more than I do. I preferred the Amarillo Slim book.

_\* I don't consider Wall Street a casino, although I probably should._ :)
