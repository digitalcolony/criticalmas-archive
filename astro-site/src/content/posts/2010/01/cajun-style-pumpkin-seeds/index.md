I know I've said it [before](/2009/11/tearing-through-my-first-pumpkin/), but I just love making Cajun Style Roasted Pumpkin Seeds. Here is how I make mine.

1.  Preheat oven to 385F
2.  Take rinsed pumpkin seeds and place into bowl.
3.  Add some olive oil.
4.  Add some Cajun spices.
5.  Mix it up. Look at photos below to see how covered the seeds should be.
6.  Place on tray evenly.
7.  Cook for 10 minutes.
8.  Pull seeds out and move them around and reset evenly.
9.  Cook for 7 more minutes.
10.  Remove tray from oven, let them cool and eat!
