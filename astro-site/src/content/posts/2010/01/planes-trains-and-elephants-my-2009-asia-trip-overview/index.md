Early in my 4 week trip to Asia, I discovered that slow upload speeds would prevent me from posting my travel blogs in a sequential timeline. Now that I have all my posts finished (finally), I can assemble them in order with links. I **bolded** the more important posts. At the end of the post, I list some of my trip favorites.

![stick-meat-thailand](./img/stick-meat-thailand.jpg) Will I return? Maybe, but probably not. I'm the type of traveler that would rather seek out a new destination than return to a place that I've already visited. With that said, I would not turn down a chance to return to Bangkok or Chiang Mai.
