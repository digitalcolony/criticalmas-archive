In 2005 I watched the real estate craze from a front-row seat in San Diego. My home value rocketed up to insane levels. Those with homes were drunk with excitement on how much money their home was _worth_. I got suspicious, just like I got suspicious during the craze of the dot-com days. After lots of research, which included reading the 2nd edition of _Irrational Exuberance_, I came to the very unpopular opinion that the party was about over and home prices would plummet. ![Irrational Exuberance 3rd edition](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tjQuLii0L.jpg) _Irrational Exuberance 3rd edition by Robert J. Shiller - This is still one of the greatest books ever written on investor psychology. Highly recommended._ I was told by many people:

1.  Real Estate never falls in value.
2.  Once you sell in California, you are forever priced out.
3.  I was making a mistake.

Well, the house sold in early 2006 and I escaped to the rental market where I have been ever since. We all know what happened next. Real estate prices fell hard. However, up until yesterday, I did not have a hard number to tell me what would have happened to me personally had I not sold my home. My old house was sold in February 2010 for **$200,000 LESS** than what I sold it for in 2006. And this is after the new owner put $100,000 of upgrades into the home, including a swimming pool. On March 9, 2006, in the post [Won the Lottery](/2006/03/won-the-lottery/), I said this:

> Yesterday, I received the money for the sale of that house. It was A LOT of money. The amount of profit was insane. I am another winner in the California home seller lottery. **The reason I'm a winner is because I'm not buying another home.** More on that topic in another post.

Well, that _"another post"_ I referenced 4 years ago is today. The reason I didn't buy another home is that I believed a price collapse was coming. Prices did collapse and I got away clean. Vindication.

Good man...I made a similar move but it was in '03 that I sold after doing much research not long after the 911 catastrophe and the dot com bust. A year and a half later I bought a mobile home on a small lot that nobody wanted because they were to busy upgrading to bigger homes and suv's. 
Looking forward to your follow up post.
