Today I completed my second [Disloyalty Card](/2010/05/seattles-disloyalty-card/). In [Round #1](/2010/06/my-3-favorites-disloyality-card-round-1/), my 3 favorites were _Urban Coffee Lounge_, _Makeda_ and _Tougo_. Here are my 3 favorites from Round #2.

1.  **Trabant Coffee** - I think the Epic Espresso Blend is back to its former glory.
2.  **Urban Coffee Lounge** - I love this place. They pulled another amazing Single Origin espresso for me. Make the journey to Juanita. It is worth it.
3.  **Aster Coffee Lounge** - Black Cat Espresso = Yummy!

Will I go for Round #3? Maybe. I'll save those thoughts for another post.
