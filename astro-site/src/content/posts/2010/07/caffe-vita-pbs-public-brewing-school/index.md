Recently I had a chance to head back to school. Coffee school. Every month Caffe Vita puts together a free class at their Pike Street location where the student is taught how to brew coffee using a variety of coffee brewers. The brewing methods taught are:

1.  French Press
2.  Pour Over
3.  Chemex
4.  Vac-Pot
5.  Siphon (a different sized vac-pot)
6.  Stove-top Espresso Maker
7.  Cold Brewed Coffee (samples)

For the class a single coffee is selected and then brewed in all the various methods. Students get to sample each method and discuss how the brewing method alters the taste. This is an outstanding fast paced class that any fan of coffee should attend.
