I finished another great book on my reading list.

![Pandora's Seed: The Unforeseen Cost of Civilization](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xuurPPmFL.jpg) _Pandora's Seed: The Unforeseen Cost of Civilization by Spencer Wells_ is about the effects of civilization. It wasn't too heavy in science. The writing was very conversational and the topics were quite varied. Although some of the reviewers didn't like that, I did. By not digging too much into the details, the author was able to express his own theories and opinions.

Most people who pay attention - even a little bit - to evolutionary nutrition know about how societies are getting fatter and less healthy. Pandora's Seed also goes into the mental health aspect. As bad as things are physically, things are equally bad from a mental health aspect.

Pandora's Seed is an excellent book that is also a quick read. This is the type of writing I like in pop science. I plan to read the author's other book called _The Journey of Man_.
