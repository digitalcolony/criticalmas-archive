This paleolithic nutrition book was high on my list to read for a while. ![Primal Body-Primal Mind: Empower Your Total Health The Way Evolution Intended (...And Didn't)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ASv5-gTZL.jpg) _Primal Body-Primal Mind: Empower Your Total Health The Way Evolution Intended (...And Didn't) by Nora Teresa Gedgaudas_ is another great book on nutrition. As I continue reading more about this topic, I find that I'm being exposed to less new information. One thing this book helped me focus on was the possibility that I had some level of adrenal fatigue. For the past 20 years, I have consumed on average 4-5 coffees a day. In recent years, it has been espresso. Before that is was mostly the french press. _Primal Body - Primal Mind_ alerted me to the fact that I was actually craving stimulates in a way that some people crave sweets and this could be negatively affecting my leptin, cortisol, and even insulin levels. To test the theory, I decided to cut back on my coffee intake. I contacted the author and she suggested taking the amino acid L-Tyrosine on an empty stomach to help. It has helped. My coffee intake is down considerably, but more importantly, I am losing my craving for the stimulate. Every book on nutrition I read provides another piece of understanding to the puzzle. For me, this book showed me how my love for coffee could be affecting my leptin and cortisol hormones. I've cut back on coffee in the past, but I usually did it much faster and I never established a "_new normal_". I just felt bad until the detox was over and then I resumed coffee loading. This time I am taking it much slower and allowing my adrenals time to heal. If you are interested in reading an excellent nutrition book, check out _Primal Body - Primal Mind_.

What are the purpose(s) of "leptin and cortisol hormones."  Is it in regards to  healing in the body?  Thanks.

Leptin is the hunger hormone and deals with energy regulation.  Cortisol is the stress hormone.  Periodic brief stressers are fine.  Constant stress is problematic.   Reducing coffee should lower my cortisol levels.  I'm almost 2 weeks into this test.  I'll post on my results.

Very interesting.  When I started this whole T thing, one of the main tests they did was around my adrenals, and the idea of adrenal fatigue.  I had never heard of it before, but it turns out my cortisol levels were really high in the afternoon for some odd reason.  We're still working on it, but it's just amazing to me how many little things affect other things like that.  Good luck with the cutbacks!

The espresso cutback is working much better than I expected.  I'm almost down to just tea.  Whereas coffee increases cortisol, tea lowers it.  The effect is even greater with black tea.  I suspect that darker oolongs and cooked pu'er teas would work the same as black tea.

Oh, good to know.  I drink coffee maybe once or twice a month, drink tea at least twice a week, sometimes a lot more.  :-)

Here is a story about black tea and cortisol.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5405686.stm" rel="nofollow">Black tea 'soothes away stress'</a>

I just bought a 6 year old cooked pu'er tea (fermented black tea) yesterday that is amazing.

Thanks!  I need to get more into teas.  I have no idea what a pu'ur tea is, but it sounds good!

Time to hit up the local tea shops.  :-)
