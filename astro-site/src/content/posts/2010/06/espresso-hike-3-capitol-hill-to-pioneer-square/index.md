Last year the Coffee Club of Seattle did two Espresso Hikes that were huge hits. The members were ready for another one and the weather was nice, so this past Sunday we did Espresso Hike #3. We met Sunday morning at 10 AM at the sidewalk location of Espresso Vivace in Capitol Hill. We started with 11 and picked up three more hikers along the way. Our route was 4.2 miles long with mild elevation changes. From Capitol Hill, we went to Pioneer Square and then through Downtown on our way back to the starting location. ![](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1273/4689112582_fe8b95de64.jpg "espresso hike #3") Espresso Hike #3 covered three top Seattle coffee places and we finished with ice cream.

1.  Espresso Vivace - Sidewalk location
2.  Caffe Vita - Pioneer Square (the location formerly occupied by All City Coffee)
3.  Victrola Coffee - Pike location
4.  Molly Moons Ice Cream - On Pine

Not this time. Opinions varied. Although I liked all three places, my favorite espresso for the day came from Caffe Vita. The summer has just begun. I expect we will have a few more Espresso Hikes this year. If you live in Seattle and this sounds like fun, join our [Coffee Club](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-coffee-club/) and look for emails on upcoming events. _Sources:_ [Espresso Hike #1](/2009/07/the-espresso-hike-1-queen-anne/) - From July 2009 [Espresso Hike #2](/2009/09/espresso-hike-2-queen-anne-to-downtown/) - From September 2009 Caffe Vita - Pioneer Square location [Victrola Coffee](http://www.victrolacoffee.com/) - Seattle roaster and coffee shop.
