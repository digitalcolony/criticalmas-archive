After almost six years of listening to satellite radio, I gave it up and returned to regular old terrestrial radio earlier this year. If you want to know the reasons, read [Why I Am Not Renewing My Sirius XM Radio Subscription](/2010/02/why-i-am-not-renewing-my-sirius-xm-radio-subscription/). How am I holding up?

Here were the channels I most listened to on XM Radio and my new substitute.

For the most part, I am pleased with the substitutes. KEXP 90.3 FM is a great station and as a result I listen to more indie rock these days. My biggest shock turned out not to be programming, but sound quality. I miss the higher quality sound of satellite radio. I am strongly considering getting [HD Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Radio). Going from XM to FM is like going from FM to AM.

Just as long as you realize that HD radio isn't necessarily higher quality.  :-)  Yes, it's digital, but the ways in which it is generally use result in a sound quality roughly equal to regular FM radio.

I reviewed the WIKI.  If I read it correctly, the HD technology allows for higher quality, but it is up to the station to determine that level.  

"Stations may eventually go all-digital, thus allowing as many as three full-power channels and four low-power channels (seven total). As defined by iBiquity these channels could be sub-divided into CD-quality (100 kbit/s), FM-quality (25-50 kbit/s), AM-quality (12 kbit/s), or Talk-quality (5 kbit/s) channels. Alternatively, they could broadcast one single channel at 300 kbit/s."

Most of my current FM problems are less to do with fidelity, but more about signal dropping.  Micro-second fades to static.  Worse than San Diego.  

I'm probably just better off with MP3s, which I believe was your position 6 years ago.  ;)

My vote is for records. :)  Also you should consider working 91.3 into your rotation; community radio is awesome!

I tried records, but the needle kept jumping when I drove up Queen Anne Ave.  ;)  I'll give 91.3 a listen.
