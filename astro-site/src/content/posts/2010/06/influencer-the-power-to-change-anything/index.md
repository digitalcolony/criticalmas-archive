I was interested in learning more about influence. This title jumped out at me.

![Influencer : The Power to Change Anything](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41nTYDX7XFL.jpg) Influencer : The Power to Change Anything by Kerry Patterson and 4 other authors is full of stories on how groups and organizations can influence change. They break down their strategies into six sources of influence.

1.  Make the Undesirable Desirable - Personal Motivation
2.  Surpass Your Limits - Personal Ability
3.  Harness Peer Pressure - Social Motivation
4.  Find Strength in Numbers - Social Ability
5.  Design Rewards and Demand Accountability - Structural Motivation
6.  Change the Environment - Structural Ability

Most of the book was interesting, but not that applicable to my life. If I were a manager, director or higher in a company, I think I'd appreciate this book more. The one lesson I took away from this book was the importance of stories. Combining lessons and values into stories have a more powerful effect on influence than telling people what they should do.

If you really dig stories on when influence works and doesn't work, check out _Influencer_. If you are more like me, just read Chapter 3.

I recently read a book I think you may like.  "The Hidden Brain" talks about how your subconscious affects your decisions.  It is written in the style of Gladwell.  The only problem I see is it is very hard to trick your subconscious and you will likely only know about bad decisions in hindsight.

I think that I mentioned that I took the class that was based on the book.  I found it very interesting and useful.

@thomas - thanks for the book recommendation.  

@TigerAl - I think I would appreciate this book more if I was part of an organization.  Since 2002, I have either been self-employed or worked for super small companies in a non-managerial role.
