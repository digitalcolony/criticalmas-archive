I received this recipe from a vendor at the farmers market. I used raw milk in place of cream and adjusted the ratio of ingredients. This soup was super delicious. Give it a try. If you don't have goat sausage, go ahead and use a _quality_ pork sausage. **Summary**: _A Toscana soup recipe using a spicy goat sausage._ ![](./img/goat-soup1.jpg "goat-soup")

-   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Looks and sounds good! Of course, I will have to substitute pork for the goat :)

We are fortunate enough to have a farmer's market that has goat as both stew meat and sausage.  This recipe is a classic sausage and leek soup and is wonderful on a cold snowy afternoon.
