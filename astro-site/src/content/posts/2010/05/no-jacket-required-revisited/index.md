In December 2008, I did a post titled [No Jacket Required](/2008/12/no-jacket-required/). It detailed my experiment with cold weather exposure. At the end of that winter I shared my results in the post [Still No Jacket Required](/2009/04/still-no-jacket-required/). Since I didn't post about it this past winter, you might be wondering if it was a one time test. Nope. I did it again. When I returned from the heat of [Thailand](/2010/01/planes-trains-and-elephants-my-2009-asia-trip-overview/) back to Seattle in December, the temperature was in the 20s for a few days. During that week, I wore either a long sleeve shirt or a sweater. Then it seemed like we didn't really have a winter. Very few days were in the 30s. There were mostly days in the 40s. As a result, I didn't wear a coat once last winter. I almost always wore short-sleeved shirts. The adaptation that I went through last winter carried over. ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4273911632_6e71eef1aa.jpg "winter party") _A kindred spirit! Photo [Winter Party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/watt_dabney/4273911632/) by Watt Dabney_ At an art walk recently, someone remembered my test from the previous winter and then noticed that I was the only person in shorts that wasn't the slightly bit cold. He inquired how to develop this skill. Here are the two tips I shared with him.

1.  **Wear Fewer Layers** - This is the best strategy to pursue during colder weather. The discomfort goes away quickly, especially if you are moving. The body learns how to be comfortable at a wider range of temperatures.
2.  **Cold Water Rinse** - At the end of every shower, do a cold water rinse. Aim the cold water at your shoulder blades, legs and arms. It doesn't have to be ice cold. Work up to it. When I started with 30 seconds of moderately cold water, it really shocked my system. Now I can yawn through 3 minutes of an ice cold water rinse. This strategy is perfect for the summer and is probably the reason my first winter adaption carried over.
