This past Saturday I finally got around to doing something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I went to a gun range and fired some pistols. Before heading to the range, I spent several hours doing classroom instruction from a certified NRA instructor. I should be getting my _NRA Basic Pistol_ certification (or is it a card?) in the mail soon. At the range, I fired two 9MM (_Ruger_ and _Glock_), a 22, and a .40 caliber _Glock_. The 22 was too small for my hand, but I enjoyed the others. Someone recently asked me if there was any other reason besides weight lifting why one would do [grip strength training](/2010/05/kung-fu-grip/). Shooting a .40 caliber _Glock_ might be a reason. Maybe being able to close a 167.5-pound Captains of Crush single-handed helped me handle that _Glock_? Couldn't have hurt.

I have the Glock 19 and Ruger 22. Both great guns. I usually carry the Glock on road trips but for home protection I prefer the Remington 870 express with double 00.

Love the Glocks.  Just fired a .40 Glock for the first time a week or two ago.  I really want to try a Sig soon.  I hear they are fun to shoot.
