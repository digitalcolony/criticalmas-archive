Last Sunday the _Coffee Club of Seattle_ visited _Dubsea Coffee_ in the White Center area of Seattle. _Dubsea Coffee_ opened in November 2009 and uses _Stumptown Coffee_. It is a beautiful location and they serve great coffee, but what makes _Dubsea_ unique is they have an amazing latte etching artist on staff.

Joerael Elliott was there making killer designs on our lattes, macchiatos, mochas and even hot chocolates. Below are some photos we took of our drinks. Thanks Joerael for coming into work on your day off for the Coffee Club!

I have set-up an RSS feed for your blog some time ago and found this article and the pics about the Latte Art. I am honestly amazed about them. This is truly artistic and would love to see more. I will share this link now on twitter.com/baristaworld.

Best regards,
Nana
