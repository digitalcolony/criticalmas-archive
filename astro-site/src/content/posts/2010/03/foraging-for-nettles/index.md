This weekend I slipped on some gardening gloves, grabbed a pair of scissors and went foraging for nettles. Not sure about the legality of taking a bag of nettles out of a Seattle park, but they sure tasted good and the price was right. ;) ![nettles-3](./img/nettles-3.jpg) ![nettles-2](./img/nettles-2.jpg) ![nettles-1](./img/nettles-1.jpg)

That's cool!  I had no idea you could eat those things or that you would want to.  Your reference page says they are high in a lot of great vitamins.

How do they taste?

Like a cross between spinach and seaweed.  Add salt.

Nettles do have stingers, so it is pretty labor intensive to pick, clean and blanch.  It won't be a diet staple, but something to have a few times a year.

Oh, I've been stung by the damn things many times.  So, eating them could be construed as some sort of revenge?

Absolutely.  When nature rubs you the wrong way, grab your fork.  ;)

Has someone been listening to Splendid Table?  That was a topic discussed last weekend.

Actually I never heard of the show.  I may be the only person in Seattle that doesn't listen to public radio, but now that I canceled my XM that may change.

As to the nettles....make sure you eat the roots too.  That's where the beneficial plant sterols that help with BPH live. "Phytomedicine 2007 Aug; 14 (7-8) 568-79"
