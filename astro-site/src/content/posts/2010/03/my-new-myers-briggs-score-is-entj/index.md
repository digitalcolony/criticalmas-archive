It has been a few years since I last took a [Myers-Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) personality test. On Wednesday, I took the test again and my score changed. I went from being an INTJ to an ENTJ. You were warned. ;)

I tend to rotate between these two also ...when I am doing more management and less analysis I tend to become more extroverted (and get an E).

Are you still investing?  Just curious, since you haven't posted anything about this lately.

My E/I was borderline.  

I probably will do a new financial post soon.  I'm still bearish.  ;)

I'm still more on the bearish side of the fence also, but have been waiting for a Hindenberg Omen to trigger short entries since last summer...            :(

I don't know if we have another collapse (like the GD) or just stay in a wide range for another decade (like 1965 to 1980).  Both are bearish views, but have significantly different implications for investing, politics, etc.

@Jim - Nate's Economic Edge had a great article on the importance of <a href="http://economicedge.blogspot.jp/2010/03/foundation-of-economies.html" rel="nofollow">RULE OF LAW</a> as a foundation for prosperity.  It jives with everything I've said about how a true recovery can only come after honesty is restored.  

Every day I wake up to a new story on how a law isn't being enforced or circumvented.  Makes it tough to get excited about investing.  Modeling valuations I understand.  Modeling fraud is something I suck at.  :)
