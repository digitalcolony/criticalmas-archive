For the most part I like how the holidays are spread across the calendar, but if I were King for a day, I'd make the following changes.

**MLK Day**

I would change Martin Luther King Day to Civil Rights Day. There were lots of important historical figures that helped advance civil rights, not just MLK. Use this holiday to highlight 2 or 3 people each year. Make it an educational holiday. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a stupid concept, but every year it does draw attention to the new inductees. The problem with MLK Day is it only draws attention to MLK.

The holiday should be moved to the Monday after the Super Bowl. Mid January is too soon for a holiday after Thanksgiving and Christmas break. Plus it will give the sports announcers something else to discuss during their 12 hour pre-game show. A little history lesson for a captive audience.

**April Fools Day**

I think last week proved that every year is too much. I propose April Fools Day should only occur on odd years.

**Easter**

Easter is "...the first Sunday after the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the vernal equinox." As a result the date of Easter varies between March 22 and April 25. Too confusing. How able we settle on the first Sunday in April? Hope that isn't blasphemous.

**Presidents Day**

More companies and schools celebrate MLK Day than Presidents Day. The reason is February is just too close to MLK Day. Since I pushed that to early February, I propose moving Presidents Day to mid October. This is the month that Americans are most likely to be paying attention to elections. Why not focus on past Presidents then?
