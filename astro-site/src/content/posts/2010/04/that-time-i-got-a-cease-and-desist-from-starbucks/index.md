With all the talk about the new Starbucks location opening up that will serve alcoholic drinks, I think this story is relevant.

Way back in 2001, INeedCoffee published a collection of [Espresso Martini](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-martini/) recipes. One drink recipe used a Starbucks trademarked name in part of the title. Their lawyers discovered the page two years later and I was ordered to make changes.

I'm not going to spell out the drink, but I think you know what I'm talking about. For the purposes of this post, I'll substitute the word CRAPPUCCINO for the real beverage name. I complied with their request by renaming the recipe _Just like a --frozen iced espresso-based beverage--!_

Here is part of the blog I wrote on July 21, 2003.

> This is funny for two reasons. First, what moron could possibly mistake a vodka and Bailey's based drink for a CRAPPUCCINO? Imagine some yokel telling a barista they didn't put enough liquor in their drink. _A CRAPPUCCINO has to have vodka in it, I read it on the Internet!_ The second reason this is funny is the phrase 'stringent quality control.' Our recipe used fresh homeroasted espresso made from a custom blend by Tom of SweetMarias. A CRAPPUCCINO uses stale over-roasted drip coffee which is masked in flavor by massive amounts of sugar. When it comes to quality control, we've got them beat.

On August 1, 2003, we did release a reverse engineered version of their CRAPPUCCINO called [An Espresso Based Frozen Drink Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/an-espresso-based-frozen-drink-recipe/). Since we didn't violate any trademarks, we never again heard from their attorneys.

A Starbucks concern in 2003 was not having their customers believe they were serving alcohol. Now they have a new concept store where they just applied to sell beer and wine. I find this amusing.
