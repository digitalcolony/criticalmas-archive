Since reading [The Upside of Down](/2009/10/the-upside-of-down/), I have been interested in simple versus complex systems. That is why this book caught my eye.

![Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h0amELy9L.jpg) _Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple) is by Jeffrey Kluge_r. It is not at all like _The Upside of Down_. It is a collection of stories of different systems that are more or less complex than appear on the surface. _Simplexity_ is written in the pop-science format that [Malcolm Gladwell](/2009/09/blink-the-power-of-thinking-without-thinking/) uses in his books.

For me, this book was fun and easy to read. It doesn't cover the growth imperative, collapse, or deep collapse concepts that Homer-Dixon explains in _The Upside of Down_. Maybe it isn't fair to compare these books, but honestly, I only came to this book because I loved _The Upside of Down_ so much.
