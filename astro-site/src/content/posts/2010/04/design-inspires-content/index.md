Since I pulled the plug on _Coffee Hero_, I have noticed that I am writing less here on CriticalMAS. It should have had no effect, but it has. I think the reason is that both sites use the [PressRow](http://www.pearsonified.com/2006/05/pressrow_theme_for_wordpress.php) theme. When they were both humming along, all was well. Now that _Coffee Hero_ is rusting on the digital front lawn, it kind of makes this site look bad.

Whenever I've run out of motivation on a website, the root cause is almost always that the design is lacking inspiration. I need a new look for this site. **Design inspires content.** A new design will be coming soon.
