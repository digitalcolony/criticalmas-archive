This is a double book review. Actually, I listened to the audiobook format for both of these books.

After reading [The Selfish Gene](/2010/08/the-selfish-gene/), I was interested in reading something more recent on genetics. The Primal Blueprint brought up the topic of epigenetics, which the science of changing gene expression by mechanisms other than DNA. Epigenetics explores how the environment can alter our gene expression. I've seen many references to the _Biology of Belief_, so I decided to get a copy. However, the wait time for that book is months long at my library, so I got the author's two subsequent books.

![The Wisdom of Your Cells: How Your Beliefs Control Your Biology](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31sC26sMqfL.jpg) _The Wisdom of Your Cells: How Your Beliefs Control Your Biology by Bruce H. Lipton_

![Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (and a Way to Get There from Here)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iHjLEwPGL.jpg) Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (and a Way to Get There from Here) by Bruce H. Lipton Ph.D. and Steve Bhaerman

I loved both books. Dr. Lipton does the voice work on the first audiobook and splits the voice work with his co-author on the second. Both are passionate about the topic. I came into the book with no knowledge of epigenetics and now I feel I have a good understanding of the author's thesis. **We are not slaves to our genes.** Environment plays a huge role and how we perceive our environment can impact gene expression. Change the environment or our perception of the environment and the cells can alter their genetic expression.

I do not have a strong science background and I know that there are people smarter than me that agree with and disagree with the author. Some critics take aim at the belief angle of these books. Maybe they are right. I know that the new age spirituality folks have embraced Dr. Lipton and that does raise my skeptic flag. However, I know belief is a powerful variable when it comes to human health. The fact belief is not measurable does not make it immaterial. Dr. Lipton does an outstanding job of bridging the gap between cellular biology and our perceptions.

_Wisdom of Your Cells_ is a good place to start to understand epigenetics. _Spontaneous Evolution_ expanded upon the topic and added a philosophical element to society as a collection of cells. Really cool analogies.

I highly recommend both books and hope to read the _Biology of Belief_ once my turn is up at the library.

Michael,
Great serendipity.  From a little surfing on an economics site, I linked over to the Art of Manliness site, linked over to another article, and found your comment on BAT.  I, too, am a follower of de Vany's works, and have been doing the cold showers for almost the last 2 years.  I enjoyed your post "The Media Discovers Brown Fat."  So, when going to your home page and seeing your above book reviews, I new it was going to be a good day.  I bought The Self Gene just a few days ago, it arrived in the mail yesterday.  

So, upon reading an econ website, within 5 minutes I was on your site in a way realizing that, YES, there are others out there on the same path.  Great website, good stuff.  I shall have to check out these Lipton books based on your review.  Cheers.

@Zachary - Thanks for stopping by.  I just added your site to my RSS Reader.  Big congrats on your fat loss.  Very impressive.  

I see example after example of men that are making huge progress with paleo.  For some reason this message is <a href="https://criticalmas.org/2010/08/where-the-paleo-message-is-failing/" rel="nofollow">failing with women</a>.
