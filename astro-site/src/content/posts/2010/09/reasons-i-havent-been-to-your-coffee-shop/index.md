Believe it or not, I haven't been to every coffee shop in Seattle. Nor do I plan to. Why not? Below are the _6 Reasons I Haven't Been To Your Coffee Shop_.

1.  **Coffee Doesn't Get Top Billing** - I am much more likely to visit a coffee shop that serves food than a restaurant or cafe that serves good coffee. I'm here for the bean, not cupcakes or sandwiches.
2.  **Not Disclosing Your Roaster** - I avoid coffee shops that hide to fall to disclose their coffee roaster. Why hide that information from the customer? Be proud of your roaster. Show the [sticker](/2010/06/looking-for-the-roaster-sticker/) or at least mention them on your website. The coffee fan must assume the coffee is inferior when this information is hidden.
3.  **Your Roaster Sucks** - There are a few local roasters that I think are terrible. If you open a new cafe using one of these roasters, I will assume you know little about coffee and I will avoid your business. If you need help choosing a roaster for your business, I can provide unbiased assistance.
4.  **Stupid Name** - Places that use stimulate adjectives in the name (EX: jitter, wired, buzz) almost always are terrible.
5.  **Trying to Sell Franchises at the Cafe** - There is one upstart coffee shop in Seattle that is doing this. I refuse to name them or try them. They seem sleazy.
6.  **Give Me Time, Let Me Know or Invite Me** - It may just be a matter of time before I get to a coffee shop. I may not know about the place. You can always invite me. Last year [Caffe D'Arte invited](/2009/06/an-espresso-journey-through-italy-caffe-darte/) me down and shared their different coffees.

How about you? Do you have any rules or red flags when it comes to trying out a new coffee shop?

_This place violates rules #1 and #3 and thus I haven't been there._

This happened to me when a coffee shop said they were serving intelligentsia coffee, but it turned out that they were serving some generic brand and passing it off.

Agree, not disclosing your roaster is a red flag. I would like to compliment the cafe on their choice of roaster if I like it and pass that recommendation on by word of mouth or tweet.

So wait, there are some roasters who suck, and you won't drink their coffee, but if I want advice on which roaster to use, you'll provide unbiased assistance? Please click this link: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unbiased

@Jesse - Unbiased in that context means that I do not work, nor have ever been employed by any of the roasters that I would be recommending.  Since there are places I dislike, maybe I should have said "Biased but independent"?  :)

@Jesse - I crossed out the word "unbiased" in the post.

"biased and independent".  I like that.

This inspired me to write a post about my rules on what things to avoid in Korea cafes -- http://frshgrnd.com/2010/09/three-rules-of-thumb-for-avoiding-bad-coffee-in-seoul/

Just want to ensure you know exactly what you are. And yes. It is personal
