I rarely read fiction. It's not that I don't appreciate the genre, but I always seem to prioritize non-fiction. This past weekend I took a quick break into the world of fiction.

![Con Ed](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aYNyFZcVL.jpg) Con Ed by Matthew Klein is about a con man that decides to live a clean life after prison but is pulled back into the game. The first half of the book was lame. I felt like I was reading the script to some TV show from the 80s. But, I stuck with the book and it got a lot better. By the end of the book, I was really into the story.

Maybe I was conned into thinking the book was simple and predictable so I would end up liking the book in the end?
