I tried to go [30 days](/2010/08/going-on-a-distraction-diet/) without connecting to Facebook. I failed. Besides being an agent of distraction, Facebook is the best contact management system ever created. I was receiving emails for events that required a response before September. And I got some new friend requests. It would be rude to leave them hanging for 3 more weeks. So I caved on my Distraction Diet and connected to Facebook.

I've been successful on turning off Twitter and the news sites, so this isn't a total loss.

Facebook is still a distraction, but it is also essential. I'm thinking about doing a 1-day-a-week strategy or maybe two 15 minute blocks. I'm not sure yet.
