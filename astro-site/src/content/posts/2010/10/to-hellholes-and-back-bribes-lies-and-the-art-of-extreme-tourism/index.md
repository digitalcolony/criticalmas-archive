Since I really enjoyed Smile When Your Lying, I decided to read the most recent book by Chuck Thompson. ![To Hellholes and Back: Bribes, Lies, and the Art of Extreme Tourism](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yh6PrSD3L.jpg) _To Hellholes and Back: Bribes, Lies, and the Art of Extreme Tourism by Chuck Thompson_ is a must-read. This book is hilarious and insightful. I'm usually the type of reader that is eager to get to my next book - due to my ever-growing list of books that I _need_ to read. Not this time. I savored every page. The premise of the book is Chuck will travel to four places that he refers to as _The Four Horsemen of My Apocalypse_. These are places that he has avoided in his many travels. The Congo, India, Mexico City, and Walt Disney World. Yes, Walt Disney World. Funny stuff. I highly recommend this book.
