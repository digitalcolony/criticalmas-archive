In the last year, I have donated money to four developers via PayPal. Their code was of benefit to me and they had established a relationship with PayPal. Putting a few bucks in their tin was easy for me to do. Of the four developers, one did something that I deeply appreciated. **He thanked me.**

When we are out in public and we give money to tip jars or the open guitar case of a street musician, we get thanked either verbally or with a smiling nod. This is polite behavior. If developers wish to increase their PayPal donations, I highly recommend thanking the people who voluntarily give you money. A simple thank you email takes no more than 30 seconds, but it lets that person know your appreciation.

Earlier this year, I added a PayPal donation setup on my coding site. Of all my sites it is one where a donation system seems the most appropriate. Developers can cut and paste my code into their projects and bill their clients or employers. If they deem the code helpful, I wanted a way for them to tip me.

I've received 4 donations and I've sent each one a quick _thank you_ email.

My email _thank yous_ probably won't increase the number of donations I get, but it may make that person feel better about donating to another developer. And you might be that developer. So I encourage all developers that accept PayPal donations to say **_thank you_**.

I rarely get thank yous when I tip.  l let it go but it still gets to me.  Maybe it is the amount (15% to 20%).  I don't think people remember average tippers in general.  Only the large and small tips gets service commensurate with the tip.

btw: try expresso with steamed unsweetened almond milk.  brings out the flavor of each.

Good post.  I always send an email thanking the user for their donation.  It's a good practice to get in to.  Here's the basics:

@Matt - I like your thank you note, especially the part about being available to answer questions.  I'm going to add that to my future notes.
