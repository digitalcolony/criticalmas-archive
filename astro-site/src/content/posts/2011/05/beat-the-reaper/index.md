I rarely read fiction, so take this review with a grain of salt. ![Beat the Reaper: A Novel](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uA9pFGSLL.jpg) Beat the Reaper: A Novel is by Josh Bazell. About two weeks ago I decided I needed a break from all the non-fiction books I've been reading. After a little research, I found _Beat the Reaper_ was available at my local library. So I went down to the library and picked it up. As I made my way up to the checkout, a librarian saw the book in my hand. She called out to me and said I was going to love that book. She then proceeded to tell me that everyone at that works at that branch has read and enjoyed _Beat the Reaper_. What an endorsement! I did love this book. It was a super fast-paced action story that connects organized crime and medicine. One reviewer calls it _House_ meets _The Sopranos_. I don't think I can improve upon that analogy. That pretty much sums it up. Excellent book.
