After the [radiation](/2011/03/nutrition-radiation/) story hit, I went out and got a bunch of sea veggies. Then I located a book with ideas on how to cook with them.

![Vegetables from the Sea: Everyday Cooking with Sea Greens](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C9ZYFTQML.jpg) Vegetables from the Sea: Everyday Cooking with Sea Greens by Jill Gusman is the best book I could locate on the topic of cooking with sea vegetables. The first part of the book goes through the different types of sea veggies and highlights their nutritional values. It is an excellent primer on the topic.

The recipes have excellent photography, which I appreciate. While I was reading this book, I just started tossing seaweed into my own dishes. I now add different varieties of seaweed to my soups, stews, meat loafs and I've even tried it in kimchi. So I never got around to actually trying any of the recipes. The book is still excellent if you need ideas. I guess I just prefer the hacking method.
