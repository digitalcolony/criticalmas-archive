On Pike Street between 4th and 5th Avenue, if you look up to the 6th floor of the Filter building you will see a Super Mario display made entirely of Post-It notes. I heard about this in the news Friday and went down today to see for myself.

Here are some photos I took.

Another building nearby paid tribute to Star Wars with Post-It Notes.
