The weather has been so nice in Seattle, that I feel more like exploring than blogging. Today a few members of the [Coffee Club of Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-coffee-club/) walked over to the Lake View Cemetery and located the grave of [Bruce Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee). ![bruce-less-grave1](./img/bruce-less-grave1.jpg) ![bruce-less-grave2](./img/bruce-less-grave2.jpg) Bruce Lee's son [Brandon Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Lee) is buried next to him. ![brandon-lee-grave](./img/brandon-lee-grave.jpg) If you go to [Lake View Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_View_Cemetery_%28Seattle%29), the grave is at the high point of the cemetery in the center just off the road.
