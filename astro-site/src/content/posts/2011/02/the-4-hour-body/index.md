Finally finished reading it.

![The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cNfXkcF8L.jpg) _The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman by Timothy Ferriss_ is a pretty good book. I don't agree that eating first thing in the morning accelerates fat loss and I think the _Geek to Freak_ chapter is [dishonest](/2011/01/how-tim-ferriss-really-gained-34-pounds-of-muscle-in-28-days/). However, the book is fun. I'm sure anyone with even a passing interest in fitness or nutrition will find something that sparks their interest. Tim is really good about being an ambassador to some of the great minds in fitness.

People have already started asking me my thoughts on the _Slow Carb Diet_. My opinion is it is much better than the standard American diet and that many dieters could benefit from that plan. I can see how this diet combined with a cheat day would be easier to follow than a paleo diet. Is it superior? The best diet is the one that inspires you and the one that you stick to and follow. For me, it would be a huge step backward, but I'm already at my ideal weight and not the target audience for this chapter.

If I were to change one component of the _Slow Carb Diet_ it would be the legumes section. With legumes, I would include mentioning soaking and/or sprouting prior to cooking. It is [easy to do](/2010/09/nourishing-kitchen/).

The highlight of the book for me was the Reversing Injuries section. I knew about wearing flat shoes and have been doing Egoscue exercises for a decade, but I was unaware of some of these other techniques. I'm injury-free now, but knowing about these other excellent strategies is worth the price of the book. There is also an excellent appendix called _Spotting Bad Science_, which should be required reading for every medical reporter.

What sparked my interest the most? Probably the bench press chapter. I've always had trouble with that exercise. This summer I will try out his plan.

@Sheila - Tim is on board with something I've been playing with now for a few years, which is <a href="https://criticalmas.org/best-of/cold-weather-training/" rel="nofollow">cold weather training</a>.  You can read my posts, which I think go into greater details than 4HB.  

His 300% number was based of - I think - just 2 examples.  Him and one subject.  Both male.  

I'd really be interested to see how women respond to cold weather training.  Tim uses a method that I never tried, which is resting on a bag of ice (between shoulder blades).  I've been wearing short sleeve shirts in the Seattle winter and taking cold water showers in the summer.

Women *should* respond just as well.... in theory.  BAT was found in more adult women than men (7% vs 3%, if I remember the studies correctly), but because women have higher subcutaneous fat amounts, it could be harder to actually chill down the skin enough to get those BAT deposits in the upper back to light up.

Just my two cents, so far.  :-)

@Andrea - Good to know.  It is interesting that women tend to be far more sensitive to colder temperatures than men.  It may be a core vs limbs thing.
