This is for all you cereal eaters that don't have the time and energy to make eggs in the morning. Make a tray or two of these crust-less quiches in the evening. Place them in the refrigerator and eat them on the way out the door.

1.  Pre-heat oven to 400 F.
2.  Cook up some veggies.
3.  Mix up some eggs. Add cream or bacon bits. Crushed red pepper is good too.
4.  Line cupcake pan with some fat (I used tallow).
5.  Set the veggies in the bottom.
6.  Pour eggs on top of veggies. Leave some room.
7.  Cook until done. About 10-12 minutes. Time will vary.

cereal eaters, haha!

This looks like a good easy dinner for someone who only
eats every 24hrs, (me).

I just crack raw eggs open into my mouth as I am driving to work in the morning.  No mess, no fuss.

@thomas - LOL.  I'm guessing you don't have a stick shift.  :)

Can these be frozen or refrigerated? How long will they be good for each?

@Jra - I have no idea. This page suggests you should be able to.
