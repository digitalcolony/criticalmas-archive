I'm back in Seattle and I've got a list of many things I need to do. However, I ended up going on a 7 mile urban hike when I saw the sky color this morning. ![ballard-locks-orange-sky2](./img/ballard-locks-orange-sky2.jpg) ![ballard-locks-orange-sky](./img/ballard-locks-orange-sky.jpg)

What gear do you take on these hikes? Specifically, the shoes? Anything special?

Thanks all.

@Stuart - I take no more gear than a camera and/or cellphone. I wear flat shoes, currently ONITSUKA TIGER BY ASICS. Today my only intention leaving the house was to get a single photo of the sky. Then I just proceeded to keeping on hiking. So a 10 minute journey turned into 2 hours. All done on zero calories. 

Here is a close approximation of the hike.
