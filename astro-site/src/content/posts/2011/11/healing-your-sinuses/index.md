_I wrote this post in August, but for some unknown reason, I didn't hit the Publish button then._

I started tackling my sinus headache problem back in March. My early strategies were based off article I read on various websites. Nothing too scientific. Well, I figured it was time to do something I should have done a lot earlier and that was read a book my a medical profession with expertise in the field.

![Harvard Medical School Guide to Healing Your Sinuses (Harvard Medical School Guides)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pOhsTAHmL.jpg) _Harvard Medical School Guide to Healing Your Sinuses (Harvard Medical School Guides) by Dr. Ralph Metson_

I learned a few things from Healing Your Sinuses. The most important thing being that my self-experimentation is actually a good thing. The author recommends a step-wise approach starting with the simplest treatments first and then progressing to the most advanced. Two initial steps that do not require medical assistance are:

1.  Diet and Lifestyle
2.  Irrigation

Diet and lifestyle is the approach I am testing right now. Common irritants to the sinuses include smoking, alcohol, wheat, and milk. So this book validates my [most recent 30 day test](/2011/08/hunting-headaches-take-3/), which involves going dairy-free. This makes sense since I already know alcohol and wheat cause me to have sinus headaches.

For irrigation, I have been using the Neti Pot and experimenting with a sinus spray. The book states that irrigation is a highly effective strategy and I learned I could double the amount I'm currently using.

The rest of the book covers the over-the-counter medications, antibiotics, steroids, and surgery.

Huh, I hadn't heard of the alcohol/sinus connection. I will have to keep that in mind!

@Ali - Alcohol has always been hard on me. Beer (gluten) and those high in histamines (cider) are especially problematic. Vodka and gin seem to provoke the least response. I wish I found their taste interesting.
