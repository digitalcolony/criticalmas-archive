Last night I rendered my first batch of goat fat. I scored a 6 pound bag at the Ballard Farmers Market for $12. I used the same technique for rendering that I use for [lard](/2011/07/rendering-lard-in-a-crock-pot/) and [beef tallow](/2011/02/rendering-beef-tallow-in-a-crock-pot/). The color was a bright yellow. Grass fed animals have yellow fat, whereas the fat from grain fed animals is more white. The flavor was amazing. Like a more buttery version of beef tallow.

What are your cholesterol and triglyceride numbers like?

@Thomas - Perfect last time I checked. Saturated fat does nothing to increase oxidated LDL or triglycerides. If this topic is interesting to you, I highly recommend reading "Good Calories, Bad Calories".

Thanks.  I don't see how consuming all that fat can be healthy but I will read that book.

I also got a bag of goat fat from the market, to bad it was his last day ever! My dog loves it! I'm looking to get more and bones as well, hope I can find a good farm! Still not sure how to "render" it. Will be experimenting soon!

@vi - You beat me to the goat fat. By the time I got there he was sold out. He hinted to me that he might not stay retired. Maybe the goat guy will be back.
