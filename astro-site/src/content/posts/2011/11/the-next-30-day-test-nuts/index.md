My next 30 Day elimination test will be nuts. Starting on October 29th, I will go 30 days without any nuts or nut butters. Then I will reintroduce nuts, probably almonds, for a period of 4 days and monitor my heath for changes. I don't expect there to be a problem, but I won't know for certain until I test it out. Nuts are a common allergen. ![almonds-dried](./img/almonds-dried.jpg) Speaking of nuts, the comments keep coming in on the [Someone Has Been Messing With My Almond Butter](/2011/06/someone-has-been-messing-with-my-almond-butter/) post.
