Imagine you are driving through Seattle one morning. The skies are gray and there is a light rain. Up ahead you think you see a parking spot. There is a car coming up behind you. You glance over to see if it is OK to park there. This is the sign you see. :x ![](./img/IMG_0825-699x1024.jpg "seattle parking sign")

@matthew - No.  I was actually walking through this neighborhood when I saw the sign.

DC street parking is afflicted with that stuff, as well:

@Drew - Nice find!  I lived in the DC area from 1998-2000.  I don't think I found a parking spot the entire time I lived there.  I just kept driving around the beltway.  ;)

Is this sign around a university district? based on the dates it seems like a football parking sign.

@thomas - You may be right.  This was a photo I took last year and just located.  I thought it was Capitol Hill, but your logic makes more sense.
