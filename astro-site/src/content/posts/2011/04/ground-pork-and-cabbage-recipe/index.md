Yesterday I cooked up some ground pork and cabbage. This is a low carb twist on a classic Irish dish that uses potatoes. If you just got back from lifting weights at the gym, add the potatoes back into the recipe. Otherwise proceed as described.

Before I get to the recipe, I want to discuss the economics of this recipe. The pound of ground pork came from local pastured farm and cost me just $4. All the veggies and spices combined cost about $1.50. The total cost of this dish was $5.50 and it made 3 servings. **That works out to less than $2 a serving.** I could have added more onions or even potatoes if I wanted to stretch out the servings for even greater value.

Whenever the media reports that poor people can't afford to eat healthy, I just shake my head in frustration. They are repeating the same old disempowering message, which is simply not true.

**Summary**: _A low-carb twist on a classic Irish dish._

Where from Mike?

It does sound like another good idea, I will try it.

@Ed - Now that Thundering Hooves closed shop, I just put in an order with Blue Valley Meats.

I decided to just buy some pork at the local Whole Foods. It turned out great and was a way better tasting dish with the pork then substituting beef like I tried last time.

I will try your recipe tonight, sounds delish!
Keep in mind 'poor' people may not have things you take for granted, IE: a working stove; the ability to get to a store that sells good produce and meat, especially in poor neighborhoods; The time/energy/ability to cook even this simple recipe, when it is much easier to get the $1 menu at the fast food chain. 
They may also not have the $$ to get a full bottle of oil, or jar of spice, even though the amount used per meal is of little cost.

Very good dinner.  I also had grass fed local pork in the freezer, and wasn't sure what to make.  I'm eating more paleo now, and this was perfect thanks.

I frequently browse for recipes when I get stumped on what to cook.  I found your recipe while browsing. I have the pork and recently I purchased a cabbage....also I was amazed that I actually have Turmeric!  The recipe sounds good and it is different from the typical meals we have.

I love this simple recipe.   lean Ground pork is my preference over beef any day of the week.  I just bought a pound for $2.99 on special at Sprouts today, making this meal even more econimical.    I do appreciate your message of empowerment.    I'm with ya.    Chopping my carrots and onions now!  yum yum!  ( i may have some brown rice with mine.)

i don't have turmeric and I don't have any carrots. I could buy them both from the store but im short on time tonight. What can I used instead of the turmeric? and does this recipe have to have carrots??

I would just like to point out that this meal feeds 3 people for $5.50. Let's say you have a family of 6, it would cost about $11. Since you feel that this is an inexpensive meal we will multiply $11 by 3 meals per day then by 7 days per week, this does not account for any snacks, the cost to feed this family would be $231. Or just shy of $1000 per month. We are not poor and I choose to spend money on healthy food for my family, but because of that choice we do not afford cable or smart phones. It is expensive to feed a family "healthy food" and some can truly not afford it, however most are not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to afford it. I make this same meal for my family on a regular basis. It cost me about $4 and I feed my family of 6, two meals from it. That is $0.34 per person. So yes, this can be a very inexpensive meal. My pork is not grass fed and my cabbage is not organic, but I think we will all live because we aren't eating the dollar menu at McDonald's.

@Amy - I agree with you. When I wrote this post 4 years ago I was more concerned with making sure all my ingredients were the best quality. Today I factor in price much more. If I were at the store right now, I'd go for the $0.34 meal too.
