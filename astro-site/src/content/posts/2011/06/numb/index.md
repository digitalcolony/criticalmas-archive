I liked the cover of this book, so I read it. ![Numb: A Novel](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RWJOLUsIL.jpg) Numb: A Novel is by Sean Ferrell. _Numb_ is about a man with amnesia that has a condition by which he feels no physical pain. He could have a nail hammered into his hand and not fell the slightest bit of pain. This talent is first exploited in a circus and later he convinced to move to New York City for fame. The story is about trust, exploitation and learning who your friends are. _Numb_ was a quick read and the author did an excellent job of planting seeds of doubt on the integrity of different characters throughout the story. I really liked _Numb_. I'm glad I stumbled upon this book.
