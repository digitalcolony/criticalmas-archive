Do I really want to spend another [5 nights in Bangkok](/2009/11/one-night-in-bangkok-and-the-worlds-your-oyster/)? Nope. I've decided to head down to Kuala Lumpur for some urban hiking and Malaysian curry. ![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2349026792_3790c5b089.jpg "by StuckInCustoms") _Photo_ [_The Sky Bar in Kuala Lumpur with a view of Petronas_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/2349026792/) _by_ [_Stuck in Customs_](http://www.stuckincustoms.com/)

Thanks for the food tip.  I had never even heard the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa" rel="nofollow">laksa</a> before.

Considering how much you like coconut based foods and curries, you will definitely enjoy laksa.  It was recommended to me as a sleep aid while traveling to/from Asia, btw :)  

Best laksa IMO: Singapore airport, if you are connecting through there.
