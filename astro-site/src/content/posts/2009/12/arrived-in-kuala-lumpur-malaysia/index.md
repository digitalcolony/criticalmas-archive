The adventure continues. I arrived in Kuala Lumpur late last night. This is an awesome airport. The [KLIA Ekspres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLIA_Ekspres) hooks right into the terminal and drops you off in the center of the city, which is a 28 minute journey. Once at the center (KL Sentral) you can take a train or get a prepaid taxi. This is the slickest arrival airport I've ever been through.

My first day I did what I always do: urban hike. I started the day by visiting the KL Tower, which my map calls a "_lookalike of the Seattle Space Needle_". At 421 meters, the KL Tower is much taller than the 184 meter Space Needle.

From there I walked over to [Petronas Twin Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas_Twin_Towers), which are the tallest twin buildings in the world. For lunch, I took [TigerAl's tip](/2009/12/next-stop-kuala-lumpur-malaysia/#comment-3159) and went to Madam Kwan's and had the Curry Laksa. It was the best meal I've had since Chiang Mai. The perfect amount of spices. It was so good, I came back two hours later and had the Assam Laska. It was good also, but I give the edge to the Curry.

In the evening, I took a subway back to the Towers to take some night photos. That is one cool looking building. Lots more photos in the full gallery.

My hotel is in the Little India area of Chinatown. Not my favorite area of the city, but the price is right and the upload speeds are impressive.

Glad you enjoyed M. Kwan's :) Completely agree on the train to/from the city considering the ridiculous KL traffic.  

BTW, the area around little India is not great but the South Indian veg food is fabulous (ask someone in the area for a recommendation on dosas/idlis) and if possible, try the Madras (not sure whether they call it Mysore) coffee as well.  It is sweet and milky though so I don't know whether you would like it.

I'm sure you found your way to Chinatown which is a fun area too.  Watch out for rip-off "deals" and keep your wallet out of reach..

Hi. Actually I'm really envious of you. Why? Because you got the chance to travel around the world.

I live in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and found this post is really great as it has nice pictures the view of Petronas Towers during the night.

What was the name of the hotel that you stayed during your visit to KL?
