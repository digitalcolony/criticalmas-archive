After escaping the hell known as [Patong Beach](/2009/11/phuket-thailand/), I headed for the quieter beach setting of the island of Ko Samui. Although the vendors were still pushy, it was far less than Patong. If you only have a few days to spend on the beaches of Thailand, I'd go to Ko Samui instead of Phuket.

One day I took a scooter around the island and another day I did a tour which included an [animal show](/2009/11/playing-tug-of-war-with-an-elephant/), stone garden tour and a mountain trek on the back (and top) of a 4 WD truck.

What exactly is a "Tea puccino", MAS?  And, are you heartbroken that you were prevented from wearing your "Man bikini", atleast in public? :)

Tea puccino is black tea with foamed milk on top.  It was new to me.  

The "man bikini" restriction was just for one temple, so I wasn't too heartbroken.  :)
