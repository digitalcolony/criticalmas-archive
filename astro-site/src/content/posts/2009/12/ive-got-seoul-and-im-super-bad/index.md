What do you do when you have a 12 hour layover in Seoul, Korea? Hang out in the terminal or go exploring? Explore! It is time to put allthat [cold weather training](/2009/10/my-cold-weather-challenge-to-you/) to use. Once I step outside the terminal (minutes from now) it will be 41 F. Good thing I dropped $2.50 on a long sleeve shirt in Bangkok. ![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/113/300928932_3bf6d408df.jpg "Rush Hour by Stuck in Customs") _Photo_ [_Rush Hour_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/300928932/) _by_ [_Stuck in Customs_](http://www.stuckincustoms.com/) \* Post title is based off the 1970 James Brown song Super Bad.

Yeah, once I step outside of my office it will be like 20 degrees.  Hope you get plenty of practice in Seoul before you get back here.

It was 40 something and raining.  A perfect transition back to Seattle.  :)
