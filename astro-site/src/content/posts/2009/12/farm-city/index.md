What would it be like to be a farmer living in a ghetto? ![Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gCxDS4cDL.jpg) _Farm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer by Novella Carpenter_ is a very entertaining book. It tells the story of how gardening in an abandoned lot in an Oakland ghetto expanded into raising bees, chickens, rabbits, and eventually pigs. This book is more inspiration to start a garden. And although I enjoyed reading about raising animals in a city lot, I realized from her experiences that I wouldn't be doing that anytime soon.
