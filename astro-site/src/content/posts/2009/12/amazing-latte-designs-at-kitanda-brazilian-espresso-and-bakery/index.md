This weekend I went to Microsoft's neighborhood of Redmond, Washington. I really didn't expect to find good coffee there, but I did. _Kitanda Brazilian Espresso and Bakery_ made some amazing drinks for the _Coffee Club of Seattle_. Here are a few of their latte art etchings. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2579/4223268400_58d1bb684b.jpg "monkey latte") ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2562/4222503377_3b7d3b797e.jpg "snowman") ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2747/4223268082_256f559a0d.jpg "fish latte") ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2772/4222503159_9065fac4c7.jpg "bear latte") ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2609/4222503279_14c3121293.jpg "sun latte") _Sources:_ [Kitanda Latte Art Photo Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/sets/72157622963928997/) - From INeedCoffee / CoffeeHero on Flickr.

I wish I had some places near me that could produce art like that. There's some good coffee shops that I've discovered, but I haven't found ant that take it to the level of art - taste or design.
