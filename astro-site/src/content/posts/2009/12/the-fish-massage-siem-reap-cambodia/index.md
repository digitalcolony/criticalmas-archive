This was too weird and cheap not to try. Siem Reap, Cambodia has something called Angkor Dr. Fish Massage. Basically you put your feet into a tank of water filled with little fish. The fish then swarm your feet and eat off the dead skin. I think that is what they said. It is an odd feeling.

20 Minute Fish Massage - $3. This story - priceless. :)

That's awesome!  I've seen this before and thought it would be cool to try.  But it would seem like an act of animal cruelty to subject those fish to my feet...

Ok, another one of the "no way in h- - - will I ever try this" experiences for me...

BTW, why do you have considerably more fish around your feet that the TailGunner and is that a good or bad thing? :)

@TigerAl - You are correct about the fish.  They did like me better.  Maybe because I was sitting more in the corner and away from the street?  I could have changed seats to see if that made a difference.  That is a mystery that will remain unsolved.  ;)

... another theory could be that your feet needed more "doctoring"! :)

You know I do wash my socks in a mixture of TIDE and peanut butter.  Maybe that is the reason?  :)
