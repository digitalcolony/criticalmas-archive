Just when I thought I was [invincible](/2009/06/another-reason-i-no-longer-get-sick/), I got my first cold in 18+ months. To say I am stunned would be an understatement. I've been getting plenty of sleep and eating a wide variety of healthy food. The kicker is that I wasn't around anyone this week who was sick. I am a detective without any clues. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2357/2496547410_14559063e4.jpg "33/365 Down with the Sickness") _Photo 33/365 Down with the Sickness by Svenstorm_ Unlike my previous colds, I seem to progress through the symptoms much faster. Sleep has been tough, but I am loading up on the anti-viral foods (garlic, onions, peppers). I am taking no medicine, as I do not want the drugs to interfere with the body's natural methods of healing. By tomorrow, I should be OK.

Too weird, MAS, I'm having the same issue though in my case it could be a combination of fatigue, insomnia and being around too many sick people in the last week.  I feel crappy today but it feels sort of like the reaction from a flu shot.  I thought the IF made me invincible as well but could mild symptoms still occur and be in reaction to a new virus strain and building immunity?  
I agree with the lack of medication, though a stiff brandy with honey and hot water really helps :)

I did a bonus IF yesterday to see if I could starve the cold, like one does for a flu.  No luck.  

Tonight I'll make a spicy curry loaded with veggies.  Now if I could just sleep for more than 2 hours straight.
