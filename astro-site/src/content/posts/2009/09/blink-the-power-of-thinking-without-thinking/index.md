Because I like The Tipping Point and loved [Outliers](/2009/05/outliers-the-story-of-success/), I decided to check out Malcom Gladwell's other book.

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is about gut reactions, hunches and making snap judgements. The book covers situations where we can trust our instincts as well as those times when it gets us into trouble. Some of the best stories in the book are cases when having too much information will result in making poor decisions.

Gladwell is a great researcher and writer. Each book he writes is better than the previous. I eagerly await his next release.
