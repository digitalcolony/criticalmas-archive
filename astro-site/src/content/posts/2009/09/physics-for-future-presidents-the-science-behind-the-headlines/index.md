Since I know almost nothing about physics, I decided to read a book on the topic that was accessible. ![Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NypfKGGvL.jpg) _Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines by Richard A. Muller_ tackles physics as if he were briefing politicians, not fellow scientists or university students. He covers the issues of today from a background in science with as little math as possible. I loved this book. The topics covered include:

-   Terrorism
-   Energy
-   Nukes
-   Space
-   Global Warming

One section covered something I had never heard of before: [cool roofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_roof). Cool roofs are paints that reflect the sun's energy and can be used in hot regions to lower air conditioning costs. The paint doesn't have to be white in order to reflect the heat. If I were still living in Escondido, California, I'd be looking into this technology to cool [my home](/2008/04/home-on-holly-oak-lane/) without turning on my air conditioner. Industry uses, such as shopping mall roofs, could have a much greater impact on energy conservation. After reading _Physics for Future Presidents_, I realized that my years of watching TV and reading newspapers has burdened me with a lot of scientific misinformation. If you are a news junkie and wish to have a better understanding of the physics that affect today's headlines, then check out this book.
