It was one year ago that I did my first [urban hike of Seattle](/2008/02/urban-hike-seattle/). Why not turn _Presidents Day_ into an _Annual Urban Hike Seattle_ day? The weather was sunny and clear. Temperatures were in the low 40s with some wind. I almost put a jacket over my short-sleeved shirt, but [you know me](/2008/12/no-jacket-required/). Partially because I wanted to cover more distance and partially because my fingers were numb from the cold, I decided to take less photos. ![urban-hike-1](./img/urban-hike-1.jpg) _From the Ballard Bridge_ ![urban-hike-2](./img/urban-hike-2.jpg) _Greenlake_ ![urban-hike-3](./img/urban-hike-3.jpg) _Downtown Seattle_ Total distance covered today was [22.5 miles](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2566165 ). ![urban-hike-4](./img/urban-hike-4.jpg)

If I didn't know better, I'd think you were training for another marathon.

Instead of Powerade stations, I stop frequently for espresso breaks!
