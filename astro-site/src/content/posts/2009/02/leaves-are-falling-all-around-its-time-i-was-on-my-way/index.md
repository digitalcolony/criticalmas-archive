Last June I posted a [Moving Scorecard](/2008/06/moving-scorecard/) where I tallied up 18 addresses in the last 20 years. Well, it is almost certain that I will be living at yet another address. My lease ends on May 1st and I'm thinking - it is time to move. My current place is OK, but I'm paying way too much for a small space.


### What City?


I am staying in Seattle.

![seattle-from-queen-anne](./img/seattle-from-queen-anne.jpg)


### Neighborhood?


Although my ranking could change once I start looking seriously, here are my favorite [Seattle neighborhoods](http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~public/nmaps/fullcity.htm) for living.

1.  Upper Queen Anne
2.  Phinney Ridge / Greenwood
3.  Ballard
4.  Magnolia
5.  Green Lake

I love Fremont, but it is too loud and crowded for someone like me with an [early bedtime](/2008/08/i-dont-like-the-night-life/). Since I lack tattoos and a heroin addiction, I can rule out all but the North edge of Capital Hill. :lol: As for downtown, way too loud. I did [downtown living in San Diego](/2007/03/when-buying-or-renting-downtown-consider/) and got it out of my system. Wallingford is fine, but 45th is too congested for me.


### The Important List


-   Quiet
-   Safe Parking
-   Larger kitchen
-   Larger living room
-   Patio or yard for grilling / coffee roasting
-   Easy parking for visitors
-   Close to a Gym
-   W/D in unit or very close


### The Nice To Have List


-   View
-   Yard For Gardening
-   Close to Basketball Court
-   Close to Trader Joes
-   Cheap

I wouldn't overlook lower QA.  I have a full Sound view, quietness, and can walk to and from downtown in minutes. The trifecta.

There are some parts of lower QA that I like.  My biggest concern there is the parking.

Mike D - 
I love your web design.  You may have the best looking blog I've ever seen.  Very nice!

I agree with MAS, Mike D, about your blog. I particularly like how you incorporate your tweets on the sidebar. Are you using WordPress?

Bah, just make sure parking comes with your place. My building is a condo but even the people who rent get to park in the underground garage.

Thanks for the props on the redesign.  It's all powered by WordPress but I'm also importing a lot of peripheral shit from Delicious, Tumblr, and other places.

MAS, how about a single family home? Could probably get an affordable 2 br meeting all your needs (possibly maybe even get an option on it).

I would love a single family home.  It would be great having a yard where I can grill and garden.
