If my Seattle peeps need a fun way to spend an afternoon with the family, head out to Redmond and visit the South 47 Farm. They have crops you can pick, animals to pet and a huge corn maze. They actually carved up a full maze covering 5.5 acres in a corn field. The maze has shortcuts, clues, hidden signs and many dead ends. Good times! ![south-47-3](./img/south-47-3.jpg) ![south-47-2](./img/south-47-2.jpg) ![south-47-1](./img/south-47-1.jpg) ![south-47-4](./img/south-47-4.jpg)

Could just be me, but the photos aren't showing up.

Damn IE.  I don't know why Internet Explorer can't see SmugMug photos.  I had this same problem with my Vancouver posts.

Fixed.  Looks like Smugmug won't allow me to embed an 600 pixel width image at 80% width.  I wish SmugMug had a 500 pixel width image like Flickr.  :(

Smugmug has an external link setting that was turned to NO.  Fixed now.
