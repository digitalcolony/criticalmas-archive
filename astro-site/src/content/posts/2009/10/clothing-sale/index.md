One of the things I enjoy most about Seattle is seeing what _The Lusty Lady_ has up on their sign. Not as good as [Indiana Moans and the Temple of Poon](/2008/05/double-check-that-movie-listing/), but pretty funny.

For your readers who do not live in the area:  The Lusty Lady and the other such establishments are a big, ugly (not to mention, embarrassing) stain on the beautiful landscape of downtown Seattle.
