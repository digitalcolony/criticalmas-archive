The author of [The Warrior Diet](/2009/04/revisiting-the-warrior-diet/) released a follow-up book that directly addresses estrogenic foods.

![The Anti-Estrogenic Diet: How Estrogenic Foods and Chemicals Are Making You Fat and Sick](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m6Ec6xNTL.jpg) _The Anti-Estrogenic Diet: How Estrogenic Foods and Chemicals Are Making You Fat and Sick by Ori Hofmekler_ is a mixed bag. The book has some great information, but a lot of it was already covered in _The Warrior Diet_. It covers how estrogens in our food and environment are making us sick and overweight and what we can do about it.

A simplistic overview is that we should avoid foods that are highly estrogenic and consume foods and supplements that combat estrogens. If you are following a paleo-based diet already, then there are almost no changes you'll need to make to your diet. The paleo diet is already anti-estrogenic.

Here are some bullet points. Notice the overlap between this list and the notes I took for [The Warrior Diet](/2009/04/revisiting-the-warrior-diet/).

1.  Avoid soy, licorice, alcohol (especially beer).
2.  Consume cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage).
3.  Consume garlic and onions.
4.  Drink green tea.
5.  Eat citrus fruits.
6.  Organic dairy and meat are good. Non-organic is raised using highly estrogenic chemicals and is to be avoided.
7.  Chamomile is a powerful estrogen inhibitor.
8.  Omega 3 oils good (olive, flaxseed). Omega 6 oils bad (soy, corn).
9.  Also good: raw nuts, seeds, avocados.
10.  Spices that promote liver detoxification: turmeric, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage.
11.  Wild catch fish is recommended.
12.  Green leafy vegetables are loaded with phytonutrients that will assist with liver detoxification.

If you would like more details and a deeper understanding of science, then I recommend this book. The book does have recipes and a step by step plan. _The Anti-Estrogenic Diet_ is not a ["paleo diet"](/2009/06/the-primal-blueprint-10-old-school-laws-for-nutrition-and-fitness/), so it is not necessary to be low carb. Besides the information overlap with _The Warrior Diet_, my one complaint with this book was it didn't go deeper into non-dietary environmental estrogens and strategies for dealing with them. Also not covered was water quality.

It is true that green leafy vegetables are loaded with phytonutrients that will assist with liver detoxification. In fact, not only that it contains pythochemicals but it also has antioxidants that can take away certain diseases.

Most of what is in this information is correct but it is also like many articles or blogs I find online where even up to 90% is correct but the rest is misleading.  For example if someone needs to keep everything anti estrogenic in their daily diet then don't include a combination of herbs or spices that are half estrogenic or tell someone x y and z will detox your liver but x and z(in this case oregano and sage) are estrogenic.  A personal example, I wasn't thinking and accidentally shook some oregano on my pizza, the only thing that saved me from spotting was the fresh pineapple slices I ate with it.  I was still cramping like my period was going to come on but when I realized what I did I ate olives(1 big handful in a bowl) and 4 more slices of pineapple and after drinking 2 glasses of water and an hour later the cramping stopped and no spotting.  Pineapple is awesome in helping the liver and getting the excess estrogen out of your system but I am finding out that the fruit not the concentrated juice works better.  Something, I haven't figure out what yet, is lost in the processing and Pineapple fruit is better unless you have a juicer or go to a whole foods store where they sell pineapple juice but not the concentrated juice- then you will reap the benefits.  
Peace

@Tammy - I tried to make it clear in this post that theses anti-estrogenic ideas are from Ori's book and not the ideas of the blogger. So the blog is correct - as I'm just reporting what the book said. The book might be wrong or incomplete. It was published 5 years ago.

Also estrogen is something the average person can't exactly measure. Unlike body weight or blood pressure, it is a guessing game. There might be panels one can order, but that would be just a snapshot and would be expensive. 

Thanks for the pineapple tip. Last night I made a Thai red curry and added chunks of real pineapple. Yummy!

What is your opinion on Hibiscus tea and Calcium D Glucarate for anti-estrogen?

@George - I have looked it at them, so no opinion.
