I love my Seattle neighborhood of Queen Anne, but it is time to move soon. I've been given an opportunity to rent the bottom floor of a brand new house near Northgate. My living expenses will be half what I'm paying in Queen Anne. How long can I last in the suburbs? We will see. Besides reduced living expenses the biggest upside to moving will be the larger brand new kitchen. I will not miss my little kitchen. I will miss Queen Anne though. ![queen-anne](./img/queen-anne.jpg)

I give it 6 months.  Really? Northgate?

LOL.  I have my doubts as well.  6 months might end up being a very good guess.  Since I am subletting, I am not on a lease, so I am not locked if I determine that I made a foolish error.  :)

Queen Anne or Northgate....either way you're in a better place than me...I am really starting to hate Redmond.... The not being stuck in a lease thing must be nice too...

Major downgrade. Ouch. Seems unnecessary with all the great rentals available all over the place. At least you're closer to a Chipotle.
