Here is a little afternoon pickup for you. ![](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/4027708000_8874867dc0.jpg "latte art") This drink was made by Urban Coffee Lounge in Kirkland, Washington yesterday. For those of you outside Seattle, Kirkland is the birthplace of Costco, which uses the Kirkland name as a brand. _Sources:_ [Urban Coffee Lounge](http://www.urbancoffeelounge.com/) - Kirkland (Juanita) area coffee house. [Costco Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco#Kirkland_Signature) - States the Kirkland brand came from having its corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington from 1987 to 1996.

Beautiful!
Their baristas Andrew Milstead and Layla Ghambari won respectively 2nd and 3rd place in last month's Specialty Coffee Association of America's Northwest Regional Barista Competition.
