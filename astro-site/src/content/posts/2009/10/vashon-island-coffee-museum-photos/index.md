Last weekend I stopped into the _Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie_ for a coffee and found a bunch of cool coffee artifacts. Vashon Island is a ferry ride southwest of Seattle. It was a good thing I had my camera on me. Below are some of the photos I took. At the end of this post is a link to the full gallery. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2563/4000849345_d1ff73b57e.jpg "german coffee sorting machine") _Photo_ [_German Coffee Sorter_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/4000849345/) _by INeedCoffee / CoffeeHero_ ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/4001605134_c28ca40e4a.jpg "coffee scale") _Photo_ [_Coffee Scale_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/4001605134/) _by INeedCoffee / CoffeeHero_ ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/4000837035_8164932b90.jpg "1909 sample roaster") _Photo_ [_1909 Sample Coffee Roaster_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/4000837035/) _by INeedCoffee / CoffeeHero_ ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2465/4000832325_151232409e.jpg "Danish Grinding Table") _Photo_ [_Danish Grinding Table_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/4000832325/) _by INeedCoffee / CoffeeHero_ The Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie website mentions its early history connection with Seattle's Best Coffee.

> The Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie and Minglement, est. 1979 (an organic health food store) now call the Roasterie home. It is also home to Specialty Coffee and Fair Trade pioneer, Jim Stewart's original coffee company, The Wet Whisker, which eventually became Seattle's Best Coffee.

How was the espresso and coffee? The espresso was undrinkable and the Fireside Blend tasted burnt and bitter - like it came out of a fire. However, the Guatemalan coffee was extremely good. So my advice is to stick with the lightest drip they have. _Sources:_ [Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie](http://www.tvicr.com/) - The Vashon Island, Washington coffee roaster.

thanks for sharing this. It's fun to take a trip down memory lane with the coffee industry.

Bummer that the coffee wasn't as awesome as these relics.
