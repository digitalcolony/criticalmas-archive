A month ago I decided I would not renew my membership and stop lifting weights. From the rather cryptic post [Glitter Interrupted](/2009/04/glitter-interrupted/):

> The things I need to do to improve my fitness level dont require a gym. In fact, getting away from the heavy weights for a month or quarter might be just what I need.

That turned out to be half true. I need to improve my posture, my alignment, my core and my flexibility. And in the last month I have made some improvements. But I really need to lift something heavy right now. I looked into buying a kettle bell, but changed my mind once I calculated the shipping charges. Push-ups aren't working. Elevated push-ups are boring me as well. Body weight exercises are important, but I need something else. I need to return to the gym. In addition to the endorphin rush of lifting weights, I also miss watching the foolish behavior that I see in Glitter Gyms. Some people have told me they miss [Tales From The Glitter Gym](https://criticalmas.org/tag/glitter-gym/). I guess I do as well. Tomorrow I will sign up for 3 months at my old Glitter Gym.

Why don't you pull a Rocky and actually accomplish something while you lift? Like move timber or chop wood?  Buy a piddly plot of land somewhere and build a log cabin on it. One of the reasons I've never been able to do the gym thing is that I don't feel like I'm doing real shit. I feel like if God looked down on what I was doing, he would laugh (not that I believe in God). Outdoor stuff always seems more interesting and less contrived.

Sounds like fun.  Someday.  But for now it will be $99 for 3 months.  No land purchase or lumber required.  ;)

There are several Kettle ball gyms in San Diego. See if you can get a week's pass to a KB gym in Seattle. I'd like to hear how you like it. I've never tried it.

Funny you should bring up kettle bells.  A fitness company is mailing me a 25# KB to review.  I may get it next week.

Yeah , because building your body and strength is contrived. Its better to create totally random time and money demands on yourself so a God you don't believe in wont think what you are doing is contrived. Sounds like the very essence of "contrived".  BRB , gotta work on my functional log-cabin muscles
