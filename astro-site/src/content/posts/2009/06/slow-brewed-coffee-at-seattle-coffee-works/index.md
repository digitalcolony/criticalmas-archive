During my Vancouver trip, I made a visit to the _49th Parallel Cafe_. In addition to the normally served espresso drinks and a vat of brewed coffee, they also had slower brewed coffee options. The French press, vac-pot and a cool looking cold brewed coffee system. These are not the drinks you order as you are rushing to work. These coffee drinks are for later in the day. I believe 49th Parallel had a sign stating they started serving the slow brewed coffee options at 10 AM. Look at the setup in the photo below.

After leaving 49th, I headed back to Seattle wishing we had a similar option. My wish was granted a week later when Seattle Coffee Works moved to their new location next door and started a slow-brewed coffee bar. They too now offer the french press, vac-pot coffee, and a cold brew coffee system.

Those are some of the craziest coffee machines that I've ever seen. I can say that none of the coffee shops around here have anything like that.

Ditto here, but I have a intrastate road trip planned this week, and plan on making a pilgrimage to a coffeehouse that I've heard has a freaky, one-of-a-kind machine.  Fear not, I *will* report back. ; )
