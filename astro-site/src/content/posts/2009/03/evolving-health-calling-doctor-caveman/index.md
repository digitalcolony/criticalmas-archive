After reading [Mean Genes](/2009/02/mean-genes/), which was very broad in scope, I found this book which focused just on evolutionary medicine. ![Evolving Health: The Origins of Illness and How the Modern World is Making Us Sick](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DB5RQAG2L.jpg) Evolving Health: The Origins of Illness and How the Modern World is Making Us Sick by Noel T. Boaz is a very good book. I will confess that this was a tough book for me. I think the book assumes a much stronger background in the biological sciences. Several portions of the book took multiple reads to understand. Probably the best way to read this book is by just picking the chapters of the ailments that affect you and your family. The author describes the evolutionary reason for the problem, how modern society is making it worse, and then tips on making things better. For me, I got a tip on reducing back pain by moving to a firm mattress. Having a mattress that is less than firm means:

> ...a bent spinal column, stress on vertebral ligaments, and tensed muscles all night to prevent hyperextension or hyperflexion of joints.

The book covers childbirth, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and more.
