Can a book on math and history be interesting? Yes. ![The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41uQY8DkQ5L.jpg) _The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives by Leonard Mlodinow_ is a great background into the mathematics of randomness. Even though I did pretty good in statistics, I wish I would have had this book to read first. Maybe I could have turned that B into an A. ;) The book walks you through the history of understanding randomness. I really enjoyed it and plan to read the author's other books on physics and geometry.
