Yesterday I walked into my Glitter Gym and was hit with the smell of wet paint. Before I could think about why they wouldn't prop open a door to air out the place, I walked into the free weight room. The walls were painted a pumpkin orange.

Back in my Florida days I learned from an owner of a Gold's franchise that the two most common colors used for gyms are blue and red. Seeing blue is supposed to increase your endurance. Seeing red is supposed to increase your strength. I never followed up with that trivia to see if there was any truth to it. But I did have a dazed look on my face as I looked over the orange walls.

The one cool trainer spotted my look and said that they had just painted it. He then said that **everyone** hates it. I corrected him and told him there was **one person who loved it**.

The link was also for you to gain insight into why you prefer the color orange though the gym may be using the color for the socializing aspect.  BTW, this new development may make for some fun new glitter gym tales :)

Which reminds me.  I got a new tale to add later this week.  You won't believe the odd behavior I witnessed.
