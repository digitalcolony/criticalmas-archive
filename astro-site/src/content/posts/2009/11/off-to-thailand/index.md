I am off for a 4 week trip to Thailand (Nov 12 - Dec 10). This is my first trip to Asia. In 2006 I met a retired British school teacher in Auckland, New Zealand. For over an hour he told me how wonderful Thailand was. The food, the people, the beaches and everything else. Since that conversation, Thailand was been at the top of my list of places to visit. Now that plane tickets are dirt cheap and Seattle weather is approaching miserable, it is time to go. I am not sure how much I will update my websites or check email while I am away.

bon voyage!  my sister visited Thailand a few years ago and I think it was one of her most memorable trips...  Chiang Mai was one place I remember her talking about-  and riding an elephant.  I believe she also got some scuba diving in...

You can bet I'll have a photo of me riding an elephant.  I might even eat a grasshopper.  :)

It's been 20 years, but this was always my favorite place to go when I was in the Navy.  You should have a blast!

Are you going to short the phone book before you go?  Seems like maaaaaybe we are finally topping...

I'm just shorting /ES futures this time ...no slippage that way.  Though maybe I should look into PB for my retirement account...?

Glad you are having fun!      :)
