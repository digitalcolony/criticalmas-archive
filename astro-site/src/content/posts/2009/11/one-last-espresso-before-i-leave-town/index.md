Today I am heading off for a 4 week trip to Thailand. The good news is I'll get some sunshine and get away from the Seattle rain. The bad news is I'll be away from Seattle coffee for almost a month! Before leaving I got one more shot of espresso perfection. Victrola has an _Ethiopian Harrar Makeda Longberry Single Origin Espresso_ available right now. The description is dead on accurate. You taste the fruit notes immediately before the dark chocolate rolls onto your palate. It is an amazing espresso. Try it before it goes away. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/4097703515_43824d3e2c.jpg "victrola espresso") _Sources:_ [How to enjoy the single origin Harrar](http://victrolacoffeeroasters.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/how-to-enjoy-the-single-origin-harrar/) - Victrola Coffee blog post announcing the special espresso.
