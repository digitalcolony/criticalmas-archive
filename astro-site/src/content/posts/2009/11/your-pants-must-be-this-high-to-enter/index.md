Damm funny!!! I used to live two blocks south of Dicks back in the eighties in a rooming house. Good memories mostly. The thing I remember having the most fun, was riding my bicycle all over the place.

Call me an old fogie, but I honestly don't understand this trend.  I see guys on campus all the time holding their pants up with one had (cell phone in the other hand of course). It's just not practical. Or maybe they need to discover suspenders...   very very long suspender sos we can still see their boxers ?

@Jenn - I am surprised this fad has lasted for more than a decade now.  I don't think the mullet lasted this long.
