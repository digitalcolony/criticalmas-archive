When I lived in San Diego there was one traffic condition I dreaded. It was the first rain during rush hour after a long dry period. The rain would kick up dust and oil on the roads and they would have slick patches on them. Traffic would grind to halt and there would be accidents. And then I'd go to work and hear the chorus of voices about how Californians can't drive in the rain. ![seattle-bridge](./img/seattle-bridge.jpg) Seattle has the opposite problem. We know how to drive in the rain. The situation that causes traffic problems is a beautiful sunny day after a long period of dreary weather. And if that day happens to fall on a weekend, then look out. Everyone comes out of hibernation and decides to go somewhere. Today was that day. Trying to go North this evening was a nightmare. Almost as bad as San Diego in the rain.
