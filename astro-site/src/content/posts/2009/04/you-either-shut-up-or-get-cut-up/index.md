Last night I got the opportunity to watch a local live radio talk show. The show is called TBTL. Other than the show I watched last night, I've only heard two hours. It is different than the guy hot talk shows that I normally listen to (Opie & Anthony, Ron & Fez and Adam Carolla). The humor is more conversational and subtle. It has been over four years now since I abandoned AM/FM radio in favor of satellite programming. Hearing a local talk show again was a nice experience.

_TBTL show in Seattle. Just kidding. This photo is [RAF mobile radio station](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adelaide_archivist/3173742136/) by Flickr user Adelaide Archivist_

The hour I watched was a segment called _Meet The Kates_. They took three local Kates from different Seattle neighborhoods and an online Kate listener from LA and ran them through a personality test. They wanted to determine if girls named Kate have the same or unique personalities. I won't give away the results (show link: [April 15, 2009, 8 PM- 9 PM](https://archive.org/details/TBTL.APR.2009/APR.15.2009.HR2.mp3)).

When I saw the great [Bob Lassiter](/2007/02/bob-lassiter-rip/) do an hour of radio, I got to sit in the studio. This time I was in a side room with the engineer and news guy. I witnessed how the radio spots were scheduled in real time and I was there when their news guy gave vocal tips to an intern.
