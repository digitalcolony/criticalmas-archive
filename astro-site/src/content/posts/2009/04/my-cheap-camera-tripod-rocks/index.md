I got a cheap little tripod for my camera and I am very pleased. ![tripod](./img/tripod.jpg) _Photo "Take me to your leader!" by Flickr user shawnmebo_ The tripod is just $10 on Amazon and easily screws into that hole on the bottom of most compact digital cameras. I think my photos have gotten better with the tripod. ![diamond-knot-cooking](./img/diamond-knot-cooking.jpg) _Photo taken using my $10 Vidpro Gripster on a 2-second timer_ Well worth the $10 I spent. _Vidpro Gripster Camera Tripod GP-10 For Compact Digital Cameras_

And what service does the adhesive tape on the camera provide?  :)

The camera has a broken part.  The tape keeps the battery from flying out.

now you might want to spend a few bucks fixing the camera battery door there....

"a few bucks"?  Scotch tape is only 50 cents.  ;)
