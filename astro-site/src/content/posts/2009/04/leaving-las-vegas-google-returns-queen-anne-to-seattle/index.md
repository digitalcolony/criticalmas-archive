I just learned last night that Google has FINALLY fixed my bug report from back in December. From the post [Google Thinks Queen Anne is in Las Vegas](/2008/12/google-thinks-queen-anne-is-in-las-vegas/):

> I accidentally entered my zip code of 98109 and clicked the Map link and what do I see? Las Vegas. All the surrounding zip codes work fine. I discovered a bug with Google. ![queen-anne-vegas](./img/queen-anne-vegas.jpg)

It took three requests into the Borg to fix this problem, but it got fixed. ![queen-anne-seattle](./img/queen-anne-seattle.jpg) To all the people living in the 98109 zip code: You're Welcome!
