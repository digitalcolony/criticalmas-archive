Today I got the silly idea to hand draw a web page using a marker. So I took out a piece of paper, grabbed a Sharpie and scribbled out a redesign for [MichaelAllenSmith.com](https://michaelallensmith.com/). Then I scanned the ditto, chopped it up and added _mouseover_ images with just a splash of color.

I give you The Sharpie Redesign.

Believe it or not, it validates to [XHTML 1.0 Transitional](http://validator.w3.org/).

UPDATE (4/16/2009): It now validates XHTML 1.0 Strict thanks to Joe at [ArtLung.com](https://artlung.com/).

XHTML Transitional?

Weak.

Very nice JOE!  Thanks!  

I like how the hover work is done in the CSS.  Much cleaner code.  I copied it over to my server and it now validates XHTML 1.0 Strict.  :)

I'll use this as a template for some future redesign.  I have an idea that involves crayons.  ;)

Awesome man! I removed your Google Analytics code though, so you probably have to put that back in. Sorry about that. :-)

Two critiques of my work now: 1. There's a flicker when the images first load. Preloading the mouseover/hover images would be nice at this point. Maybe JS, or maybe just by loading them in-page as single pixel images. 2. Looks not great in IE6 -- there's a little extra margin between the top two hovers which makes a little ugly. If that matters you may need a little hackery.

Otherwise, I'm pretty pleased with my 30 minutes of xhtmling. :-)

1- I actually like that flicker, it draws attention to the image.  I will experiment with pre-loading though.  

2-If you have IE6, the web shouldn't look good.  Your surfing experience should be painful.  :)

thanks again!

1- Just added the HOVER images as 1x1 pixels.  You can't even see them.  No more flicker.  

Thanks!
