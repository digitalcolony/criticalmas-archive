Warrior Diet Notes
book by Ori Hofmekler


what happens during a controlled fast?
1-detoxification
2-enzyme pool is reloaded (which accelerates fat burning and creates an anti-aging effect)
3-insulin drops and is stabilized (efficient metabolism of carbs and fats)
4-glucagon increases (a fat burning hormone)
5-growth hormone increases (tissue repair and fat burning)


undereating properties
1-anti-aging - through nutrient loading
2-fat burning - through hormonal manipulation
3-destroying tumors and cancerous cells - through detoxification


undereating phase
1- living foods:  raw fruits, veggies, fresh juices
2- yogurt, kefir, whey


Raw nuts - not roasted


Vitamin and Mineral supplements important


Ginger - anti-inflammatory, thermogenic, digestive aid.  Gingerol is active ingredient (antibiotic)
Chicory - (esculetin) - inhibit the oxidative degradation of DNA.
Glutamine - brain booster, taken on empty stomach, stress hormone blocker, anabolic process


Tyrosine + SAM-e: taken on empty stomach --> boost dopamine --> increase GH, keep T high


Anti-estrogen Foods
1-cruciferous vegetables
2-omega-3 oils
3-citrus fruits
4-onion
5-garlic
6-dairy products from grass-fed animals
7-chamomile


Whey protein - look for hormone free


Soy Protein
1-inhibit mineral and iodine absorption (impair thyroid)
2-estrogenic


Cruciferous Veggies
* Indole-3 carbinol bound to fiber.  Must be cooked to be absorbed - detoxify estrogens, protect against cancer and fat loss.


Fat loss - always eat carbs as the last component of a meal


Stubborn Fat - lower ratio of beta to alpha receptors, high in estrogen receptors


Causes of Stubborn Fat
1-unhealthy diet
2-exposure to estrogens
3-aging
4-deficiencies in B vitamins, chromium, magnesium, zinc, omega-3 fats
5-protein deficiencies (need lysine to convert into L-carnitine to mobilize fat breakdown)


Prevent Stubborn Fat
1-avoid crash diets / weight fluctuations
2-avoid estrogenic food (soy, clover, licorice, omega-6 vegetable oils: canola, corn, safflower, soy)
3-eat organic to avoid petroleum based (estrogenic) pesticides.
4-avoid foods that smell like plastic.   Minimize use of plastic for food storage.
5-minimize alcohol consumption (impairs liver's ability to breakdown and detoxify estrogen compounds)
6-control insulin (minimize carbs, only eat at end of meal, eat nuts/seeds instead of grains)
7-exercise


Remove Stubborn Fat
1-Consume estrogen inhibitors
* cruciferous vegetables (indoles)
* chamomile flower (flavone apigenin)
* passion flower (flavone chrysin)  no longer believed to reduce estrogen (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysin)
* bee propolis (galangin)
* citrus fruits (flavone naringenin)
* curry (curcumin)
* red grapes or wine (resveratrol)
* omega 3 oils from fish, flax seeds, hemp seeds, milk fat (from grass-fed animals -CLA)
2-Liver Detoxifiers
* leafy greens
* cruciferous vegetables
* milk thistle
* dandelion root (start with small dose as it is a milk laxative)
* pygeum bark
* saw palmetto
3-Yohimbe Bark (**may** stimulate alpha receptors)


Foods that protect against radiation and environmental toxins
1- Sea Veggies (kelp)
2- Miso
3- Beet juice (detoxify liver and blood)
4- bee pollen (lecithin - protects nervous system)
5- high-sulfur protein containing foods (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower,kale, brussels sprouts, garlic, onions, eggs)
6- fiber: veggie,grain, legume, seed and fruit fibers
7- high chlorophyll foods - leafy green veggies, grass sprouts, parsley
8- herbs: siberian ginseng, astragalus, echinacea, goldenseal


Plastic
* acid-based foods should never be stored in plastic containers, since acid is more reactive with plastic material.
* compounds in plastic called plasticizers can be estrogenic and carcinogenic (EX: bisphenol A)
* don't eat/store foods/liquids in soft "cloudy" plastic containers
