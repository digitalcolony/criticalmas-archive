One of the great coffee secrets of Seattle is a little shop in the Greenwood area called _Makeda Coffee_. This dog-friendly coffee shop uses beans from _7 Roasters_. Even though Seattle has a lot of great coffee places, what makes this place special is the extra detail they put into their latte art. Some of the best latte art etchings I've ever seen come from _Makeda Coffee_.
