_I've bashed company managed 401Ks in the past. Now it feels like I'm kicking a corpse. Let me get one final punch in._

Today I received the year end statement for my company 401K. When I say "my company", I mean the one I worked for from January 2002 - May 2006 and again from September 2007 - April 2008. Both times I left the company, I had the balance of my 401K moved to a self directed account with Ameritrade.

Smart move.

I know people who can't be bothered with managing their retirement money. They set the contributions and then hope everything works out. I didn't believe the market was honest and exited before the crash.

Here were the 2008 returns for the 4 _diversified_ funds offered by my company.

-   \-16.79% Conservative
-   \-26.14% Moderate
-   \-34.54% Growth
-   \-40.61% Aggressive

When I look back at the 3 year returns, all these funds are still negative. In fact, **none of these funds beat the FIXED INCOME FUND over a 1, 3, 5 or even 10 year time span**. But fixed income is so boring, who would ever [advise something that boring](/2008/07/hope-your-401k-is-in-fixed-income/)?

You must admit -40.61% IS very aggressive!     :)

My wife had one of these plans at her last company.  They wouldn't allow straight cash, so we put her money in a 100% treasury fund.  The primary goal was avoiding income taxes on the money ...then transfer it to a self directed fund later.

Her other options were 7 stock funds and 2 bond funds (both of which had exposure to mortgage backed securities).  What a joke!
