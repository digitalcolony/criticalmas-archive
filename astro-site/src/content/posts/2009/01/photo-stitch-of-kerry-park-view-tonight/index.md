A friend of mine emailed me a link to some free software called HUGIN that connects multiple photos into a single panoramic image. When evening arrived, I decided to test it out. I'm using a Canon PowerShot SD 800 IS. My tripod is (sadly) 3 stacked business cards. ![stitch-1](./img/stitch-1.jpg) ![stitch-2](./img/stitch-2.jpg) ![stitch-3](./img/stitch-3.jpg) My first stitch attempt used 5 images. There is blurring on the left and darkness on the right. ![stitch-4](./img/stitch-4.jpg) Then I made a version using just the center 3 images. Somehow the sun got brighter. In this version, you can see people at the playground which is the bottom right of the image. ![stitch-5](./img/stitch-5.jpg) I plan to make more panoramic shots this year. Who knows, I may even splurge and spend $15 on a tripod. :)

Sweet.  Our old digital camera use to do that in-frame, actually.  Take one picture and it would display the a small portion of it in the view window so that you could line it up with another picture.

Sadly our new one doesn't - so I'm excited about the app.
