It has been several months since my last latte art attempt. Since I only drink espresso, I rarely get a chance to make lattes. Then I woke up the other day and saw a new post at [Naug's Latte Art Blog](http://latte-art-newbie.blogspot.com/2009/01/another-try-not-bad-not-bad.html) and was inspired.

I invited some friends over and with low expectations, I cranked out this attempt. Not bad after almost a four month hiatus.

Updated the post to just reflect the 2nd attempt.  The photos from the 1st pour sucked.  Thanks.

I know you're not a big fan of El Diablo on QA, but several months ago one of the evening baristas made the most beautiful picture of their "devil" atop my mocha.  Wish I had a camera with me, super cool.

El Diablo is the best Cuban style espresso place I have ever been to.  Better than every place I ever went to in Tampa or Miami.  But the best Cuban style coffee loses against Seattle coffee 99% of the time.  :)   

Latte etching is something I have not tried yet.  I am going to look into it.

Very nice!  I have days where the cup practically overflows and haven't got anything that looks remotely like art.  Then there are days where everything comes together and you get a pretty nice pour.

Keep it up! (aka drink more milk)
