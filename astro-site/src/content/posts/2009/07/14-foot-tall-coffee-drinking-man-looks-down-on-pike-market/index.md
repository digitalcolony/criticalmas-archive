Last week, I went down to Pike Market to see the new 14 foot _Coffee Drinking Man_ sign raised over the new Seattle Coffee Works location. I didn't hang around long enough to see it installed, so I went down today to check it out. ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2635/3740620251_4947470c20.jpg "coffee drinking guy gets ready") _Coffee Drinking Man on July 14th._ ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3741413036_2d28d767c2.jpg "Coffee Drinking Man") _Coffee Drinking Man today._

Seattle Coffee Works, is my favorite coffee shop that I've never been to. My brother that lives in Seattle regularly gets me coffee from there.

Hi, I loved Seattle Coffee Works too! I wanted to ask if I may use your 2nd photo from the top in my upcoming blog post, as part of a collage. Of course if you agree, I shall extend all credit and courtesy and copyright (and a big thank you) with linkback here to your blog. If not, no worry! I just didn't snap enough photos of this place.....thanks, ciao!
