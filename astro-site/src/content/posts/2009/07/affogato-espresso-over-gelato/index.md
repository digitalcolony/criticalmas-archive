Seattle's Muse Coffee just started serving Affogato this week. What is an affogato? Affogato is Italian for _Drowned_. Two shots of hot espresso are poured (_drowned_) over a few ounces of vanilla or chocolate gelato. Here is mine from earlier today.

I can't tell you how good that sounds right now.

It definitely looks tasty, and I love the idea -- but how did it taste??  I ask because it's giving me a recipe idea ...

It was a nice dessert.  The next time I try it, I will choose vanilla over chocolate.  The chocolate was competing with the espresso for dominant flavor.  I can't allow that.  ;)
