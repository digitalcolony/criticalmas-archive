I made another dish where the goal was vegetable variety.

![stir-fry](./img/stir-fry.jpg)

1.  garlic \*
2.  red onion
3.  red pepper
4.  green chili pepper
5.  yellow pepper
6.  kale, both steam and leaf \*
7.  green beans
8.  celery

_\* were purchased at the farmers market hours before cooking_

I explained in the last post that I create my own stir fry dishes to increase the protein and vegetable portions while decreasing the starch. This macro-nutrient approach has a host of health benefits. What I didn't explain was why I include such a wide **variety** of vegetables.

After reading [The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth](/2008/03/150-superfoods-because-14-just-wasnt-enough/), I learned that each vegetable has its own unique nutritional profile and they vary widely. **Variety is as important as quantity.**

Humans evolved to derive nutritional benefits from a wide range of vegetables. I forgot which evolutionary book I got this from, but when hunter gathers came across a new area of food they would eat a little bit from many food sources. They would not restrict themselves to just one or a few vegetable sources, for fear it could be poisonous. This is the concept of "_diversify the toxin_". If one of the food sources is bad, then eating a small amount of it still allows for survival. Advance this idea over several hundred thousand years and realize that you are the product of genes that survived and thrived on a wide range of vegetables.

And to think I used to eat the [same lunch at Taco Bell](/2008/03/taco-bell-and-the-speed-zone/) three times a week for almost four years.

Since exploring the concept of "_diversify the toxin_", my entire approach to vegetables has changed. Instead of mindlessly eating spinach and broccoli, because they are _the best_, I instead am constantly rotating and adding to the list of vegetables I eat. The result is my immune system is much stronger (no cold in over a year now) and I've gotten leaner.

Stir fries, curries and soups are three excellent platforms for loading up on a wide variety of vegetables.

So what's your Taco Bell intake now? I hear anything below twice a week and your cholesterol will get dangerously low......

Once I made it to California, the idea of ever going back to TACO BELL was ridiculous.   Rubios!!!!
