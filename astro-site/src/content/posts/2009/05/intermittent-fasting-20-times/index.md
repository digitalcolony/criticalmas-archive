The is my 4th post on Intermittent Fasting. For a background, I refer you to these 3 posts.

-   [Intermittent Fasting - Fears and Motivations](/2009/04/intermittent-fasting-fears-and-motivations/)
-   [Intermittent Fasting - Adventures in Not Eating](/2009/04/intermittent-fasting-adventures-in-not-eating/)
-   [Intermittent Fasting - Tips and Advice](/2009/04/intermittent-fasting-tips-and-advice/)

Last Friday was my 20th Intermittent Fast. What started out as unthinkably difficult is now part of my weekly routine. It is now easy. I pick one day a week where I delay my first calorie until about 7 PM. This is what I wrote a month ago in _Intermittent Fasting - Adventures in Not Eating_:

> I consider IF to be amazing success if for no other reason, I am no longer a slave to eating by the clock. If I come across poor food options, I can now choose to eat nothing. Hunger is now an acceptable feeling. Because I am now comfortable being hungry, I am longer pressured to eat fast. Taking the time to prepare a healthy meal even if it means waiting another hour is no longer a dilemma.

2009 has started as a rough year for me on the exercise side of the health equation. Most of this year I've had back problems and some shoulder pain. I'm working on those with very low-impact stretching, yoga and alignment exercises. I've had back problems in the past and been sidelined with injury. And every time that has happened I've gained weight. Not this time. Not only have I not gained weight through inactivity, I've actually gotten leaner this year.

I have just started Intermittent Fasting and have been amazed at how energised I have felt during my first 20 hour fast.  It does definitely change how you feel about compulsively eating food, your body seems go through a physical/mental/emotional re-alignment.  I am definitely hooked and will try it once or twice a week.

"It does definitely change how you feel about compulsively eating food, your body seems go through a physical/mental/emotional re-alignment."

Brilliant summary!  That is EXACTLY how I feel.  Well said.
