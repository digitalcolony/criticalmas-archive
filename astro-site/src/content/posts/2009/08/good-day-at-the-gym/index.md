I set some new personal records today at the gym. My bodyweight (BW) today is 189.

-   Weighted Dip = 3 x BW+70 , 1 x BW + 80
-   Weighted Pull-Ups = 3 x BW + 60, 2 x BW + 70

I use the 3 rep number for my personal records. This gives me:

-   Weighted Dip = 259
-   Weighted Pull-Up = 249

Today was the last day on my gym membership. I will not be renewing at this time. What will I do and where will I go next? Stay tuned.
