I am not a barista and because almost never consume anything but straight espresso, my latte art skills are weak. Today I got some half and half and did my first attempt in months. I wanted a rosetta, I got a feather. Not awful. ;) ![](./img/latte-art-feather.jpg) Stats:

-   Espresso: Home roasted blend of Brazil + Rwanda + some leftover Vivace Dolce
-   Machine: Silvia
-   Milk: Trader Joes Half and Half
