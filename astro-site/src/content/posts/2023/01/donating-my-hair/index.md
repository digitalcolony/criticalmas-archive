You already know that I am a [frequent blood donor](/2020/02/5-gallon-blood-donation-achievement-unlocked/). Now I can add hair to my donation list. I used the last 3 years as an opportunity to grow my hair long. Yesterday, I was able to donate 14+ inches of hair to [Wigs For Kids](https://www.wigsforkids.org/). 😎 ![](./img/mas-haircut-2023-white-border-650.jpg)

Never wouldve expected this blog was written by a guy with long hair.  I don't know how to feel.  How many times have you been hit up for drugs or people assumed you were a raging liberal?

@b - I cycle between military short hair and long hair.

This is by far the longest my hair has gotten. I wanted the hair to reach 14+ inches for the donation. That is the preferred length for the charity I selected. 

When I visited NYC in 1999, I was walking through a park at dusk. My hair was long then. I could hear a drug dealer saying "Coke" to the people walking by in front of me. When I walked by, he stopped saying "Coke" and said "Pot" and "Weed".
