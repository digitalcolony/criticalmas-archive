I mentioned in an earlier post that [I got a hernia](/2023/08/i-got-a-hernia/) in July. Between that time and my surgery on September 20th, I didn't feel comfortable exercising. Not pain. Just discomfort. Some men are easily able to work around their hernias and continue exercising at the same level. I wasn't. Although I tried to push my hernia back in, it would just pop back out. This wasn't sustainable. I had to get a surgery. While waiting for my surgery, I continued to go to the gym. I reduced the weight, the intensity, and the volume. But instead of going 3x a week, I increased it 4x a week. My workouts were often less than 10 minutes. I referred to my workout as the "Slow Grandma". This meant I would use machines, but [unlike the Silver Sneakers](/2014/04/silversneakers-young-trainers-teaching-old-timers-bad-lifting-form/), I would slowly control the negative and not let the weight drop. Think of the slow protocol explained in Body By Science dialed back in weight and intensity. ![](./img/3803592124_061006a667_z.jpg) This was an interesting experiment because most lifters are using either high weight, high volume, or high intensity. I was doing none of those. But I was showing up 4x a week and I was still doing [25 pushups daily](/2023/09/on-pushups/). My workouts were the equivalent of taking the car out of the garage and driving it around the block a few times. No long drives or getting on the freeway. Just circle the neighborhood and come home. Then the unexpected happened. Other than the hernia, I never looked or felt better. That was a pleasant surprise. Had I continued the "Slow Grandma" for months or years, would I see a dropoff? Probably, but I am not certain. A younger me would have taken a "why bother" attitude and stayed away from the gym while waiting for the surgery. I'm glad I didn't. Right now I am thinking back to all my lifting injuries I got before discovering [HIT](/2017/10/high-intensity-training-7-years-later/) and proper exercise selection. The months I waited on the couch for an injury to heal. What if I had done some version of the "Slow Grandma" back then? Chalk this up to another lesson I wish I had learned earlier.

I have been experiencing similar results with a similar exercise regime. Less is more. What works best for me is only one heavy weight high intensity workout out every 3 to 4 weeks.

I have the feeling a lot of people use these 4-5 times per week high intensity workouts in order to manage stress. Meditation is usually safer and more effective for that.

@Glenn - That sounds like a wise interval.

Interesting! I started doing something similar the other day, when I was craving movement, but didn't want challenge my recovery too much, either.

I went with pretty moderate load, and just continued doing reps as long as they felt smooth and pleasant. I estimate this was around 60% RM or so, could be higher, could be lower. Did a circuit of 3-4 exercises, felt good, and did it again. Really enjoyed it!

Very encouraging that you both felt and looked better using your "Slow Grandma"-protocol, as I was preparing to do some heavier stuff again (but not really feeling it). I think I'll continue experimenting with this. I just need a catchy name for it.

I tend to do what you are doing, but in the same session as my higher intensity resistance training. There are some exercises that I do not wish to push to harder levels. Crunches and abdominal work for one ( see Bill DeSimone’s views on this and spinal laxity). Another exercise is dumbbell deadlifts/ squats. I do them as a warm up, not pushing big weights, but rather as a “practice” of the hip hinge motion. There are a few others that I sprinkle in around my harder effort work.

Why not get a DEXA more often?

@exfatloss - There is a cost with DEXA. If my weight and tape measurements are constant, I don't think my DEXA score would vary much.
