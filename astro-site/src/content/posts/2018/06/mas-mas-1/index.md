más MAS is a new feature I'm adding to the Critical MAS blog. These will be links to things that I'm doing that are outside of this blog. In this first edition, I will catch up on the first half of 2018.


### Medium


[Your SEO Backlink Strategy Will Backfire With Me](https://medium.com/@CriticalMAS/your-seo-backlink-strategy-will-backfire-with-me-8768d471e180) - I get great emails from Critical MAS readers. Unfortunately, that is not true for my coffee website. This is how I'm responding to the SEO consultants that advise a backlink strategy. After this article was posted, I got unfriended by someone I know in that industry. Seems I struck a nerve. Good.

### Websites


CoffeeClub.app - I'm proud of this site. It is a dashboard site that manages the 12 years of history of the Coffee Club of Seattle Meetup group. I use the Meetup API and the Yelp API for the data and Bootstrap 4 for the design. I'm adding more code regularly.

LiftSlow.com - I planted a flag for a future site. ([more info](/2018/06/lift-slow-getting-started-with-high-intensity-training/))

[MichaelAllenSmith.com](https://michaelallensmith.com/) - I redesigned my portal using Bootstrap 4 cards.

CoffeeCookery.com - This is a test to see if I could spin off a recipe site dedicated to using coffee as an ingredient. So far I have not been giving the site much of my time. After I launched the site, I got a MUCH BETTER idea for a new coffee website. More on that idea later in the year.

_UPDATE 2020: I ended the CoffeeCookery site about a year after it launched. It was a dumb idea. My much better idea is still viable._

_UPDATE 2021: I decided not to pursue LiftSlow._

_UPDATE 2024: I abandoned the CoffeeClub.app project._
