A year ago, I posted [Medium and Blog Housekeeping](/2017/02/medium-blog-housekeeping/). The plan was to republish some of my best posts there to gain new readers. After a few months, the stats told me that almost nobody was seeing my posts. So I assumed the Medium experiment was a flop. I was wrong. ![Medium](./img/medium.png) As a reader, I really do like Medium. In an age when almost every website bombards you with newsletter pop-ups, it is refreshing to see a clean, readable site that is full of quality content. I hadn't been paying attention to my stats, or rather, my lack of stats for several months. Then I peeked at the numbers and saw 3 of my articles were doing pretty good, with one pulling over 2,000 views. The 3 articles were all tech-based stuff that I never published here. The Medium readers didn't care about my Peasant Diet. They cared about how to get their [Zenbook brighter](https://medium.com/@CriticalMAS/my-new-asus-zenbook-was-too-dark-how-i-fixed-it-5be99d95d46d). Which is interesting to me, because the few tech posts that I have put up on CriticalMAS have received little to no feedback. **OK. I can play the Medium game.**  I removed all the non-tech posts on Medium since they were here anyway. Going forward, my Medium account will just be tech stuff. If you want to follow me on Medium: [**medium.com/@CriticalMAS**](https://medium.com/@CriticalMAS) I also write coffee articles for my coffee site INeedCoffee.com. **[ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)**

I gave up on Medium not long after starting, but still get daily emails highlighting posts I "might be interested in."  I've noticed recently lots of postings from authors like Fung, Ferris, and some others. But I cannot say I was ever directed to a Medium post by Google, and I use Google a lot, lol.  

It's interesting that you are getting traffic to your Medium posts.  Perhaps it's time to take another look.

@Tim - One of my Medium posts is #1 on Bing and Google for "zenbook dark", which is a common problem for that line of laptops. I also suspect that Medium is more popular with the tech crowd, which could explain why my tech stuff did far better than the standard CriticalMAS content
