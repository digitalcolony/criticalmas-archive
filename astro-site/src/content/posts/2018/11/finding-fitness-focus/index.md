Whenever I take on too many fitness goals, I lose focus. It is much easier to direct energy in one direction than several. When my primary goal was losing weight or doing knee rehab, I made progress. However, in the last two months, I've stalled. The reason is I'm trying too many things. My current fitness goals:


#### Increase muscle


Back in August, I got excited about [increasing muscle via higher training volumes](/2018/08/heavier-weight-greater-volume-and-going-to-failure/). During the past 5 years, I have been going through the motions at the gym as I deal with a knee issue. Now that my knee is 80-90% better, I want to recapture the gains I had earned when my knee was 100%. Increasing volume has been a challenge, as I've developed golfer's elbow which was likely a result of adding too many pull-ups to my routine. High volume has been interrupted.


#### Cardio Rediscovered


Then the [cardio story](/2018/10/cardio-motivations-and-expectations/) caught my eye. I've been gradually adding some elliptical work with success.


#### Winter Bodybuilder Diet


Last winter, I was able to stay lean following a peasant diet (higher carb), but now that I'm leaner I know I'll need a more bodybuilder diet (higher protein) to maintain. So far, I'm doing fine here, but this will be my first winter following a higher protein diet. I think I'll be fine here, but I do need to be aware of holiday temptations and the reduced-activity I have with shorter days.


#### Fasting Mimicking Diet


July was the last month that I attempted a 5-day Fasting Mimicking Diet. I made [4 days](/2018/07/fasting-lessons-i-learned-this-month/). I needed to solve for heat before I tried the FMD again. And I did that recently. I joined a gym with a sauna. As I type this post, I am on Day 3 of an FMD and I feel much better thanks to the daily sauna visits.


#### Nagging Pains


As I mentioned above, I developed a case of Golfer's Elbow from pull-ups that is taking a long time to heal. I got a lot of advice recently and the consensus is to let it heal and don't perform any lifts that might aggravate it. My left knee never gets to 100% healed. I'll get 90% fine and then it will drop back to 70%. This is putting a brake on the leg workouts I'd like to do.


### I Need a Plan


As much as I would love to use the winter months to get jacked on high volume lifting, my elbow and knee are not going to allow that at this time. Maybe not all winter. Cardio is fine and I will ease into it, but it doesn't capture the motivation that gaining muscle and getting lean do. I'll probably just stay in this holding pattern for another month or two and see what happens. It really sucks that my motivation far exceeds my recovery rate. ![Focus](./img/stefan-cosma-focus.jpg) _Photo by [Stefan Cosma](https://unsplash.com/@stefanbc)_

It always happens like that. When motivation peaks you want to try many, often contradictory, things at once.
