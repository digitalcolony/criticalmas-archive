I'm sure a few of you saw some stories last week that actor [Kevin Smith is using an all-potato diet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220523155844/https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/dailymeal-kevin-smith-loses-20-pounds-on-all-potato-diet-20180327-story.html) to lose some weight and improve his health. Kevin suffered a heart-health earlier this year and inspired by the success of Penn Jillette, who used potatoes to help him lose 100 pounds and get off many medications, he has joined us here on Team Tator!

As you can see below, traffic to this blog spiked a bit last Thursday. All those extra page views went to Potato Hack related pages. Unfortunately, the search engines keep directing people to the worst two pages I have on the topic and not my _best of_ [Potato hack Diet page](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/potato-hack-diet/).

I wish Kevin the best of luck in his recovery. He has a huge audience and many of them would benefit from swapping out a few meals each week for boiled potatoes.

Silent Bob becomes Potato Bob.  Always interesting to see the nutritionist comments in this type of article.

Can you use as much good-quality natural butter with the potatoes.  thinking of trying it out starting tomorrow April 2nd but really don't like eating potatoes plain or lightly salted.

thanks.

@t. bondurant - I think you are missing the point. It is about removing flavor. No butter. Salt only if you must for the hack, otherwise, you won't get the full benefits.

@MAS

Thanks for you quick reply.  I guess I am not against an all potato diet but am trying to ask for a compromise.  I understand the meditative reasons for eating potatoes plain, desensitizing yourself to "deliciousness", but..........can't I even use grass-fed full-o-healthy fats butter (or substitute per your recommendation)?  

....on my knees begging btw.

@t. bondurant - One meal at a time. You can do it.

Well...thanks again for the encouragement...but I decided to slightly compromise so I can at least get started.  I figure it is better to start with something I enjoy, buttered potatoes, and (hopefully) switch to plain potatoes rather than start with plain potatoes and quit in a couple of days.

In the near future, I plan on drinking espresso every morning but that is more of a habit than a necessity.  Ideally I would like to eat similar to Laird Hamilton:

Started today ate one giant potato very lightly buttered.  I remember reading in the book "Siddhartha" by Herman Hesse that he said that one of his strengths is fasting because it gave him an advantage over people who couldn't control their urges; might be an interesting read.

Also what multivitamin brand do you suggest?  Preferably without iron.

I have been eating potatoes only for 42 days I have lost 43 pounds. I started at 340 and am now at 297. My goal is 225 and to stabilize the weight loss there, then keep it off for 2 years. I want to be at 200 but am being realistically conservative with getting down that low at my age. I am a type 2 diabetic, but because the starches become resistant my BP was 121/67 and blood sugar below 100 usually in the high 80's to the low 90's.

@Duane - That is awesome. Congrats on your potato success!  

I don't measure my blood sugar, but just to be safe, I will often splash some red wine vinegar on my potatoes. It supposedly blunts the blood sugar spike.
