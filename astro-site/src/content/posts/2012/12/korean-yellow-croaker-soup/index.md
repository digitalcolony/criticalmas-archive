One of the most impressive sections of Korean grocery stores is the seafood section. Lots of care and attention is placed on the seafood options. Up until recently, I hadn't purchased any fish and instead focused on the beef and pork dishes. Last week I bought some salted yellow croakers. I had no idea what to do with them, but I quickly learned that they are used for soups. The croakers I bought already had their fin removed and were ready for cooking. And unlike fish served at American grocery stores, the heads were still attached. Eyeballs and all! I kind of followed the recipe posted in the description of this [YouTube video](http://youtu.be/6KENR9ZJfqE). I didn't have the cooking wine or hot pepper oil. I also was out of anchovies used to make the [Korean Anchovy Kelp Stock](/2012/10/anchovy-kelp-stock/). It didn't matter, as the soup tasted awesome. My fish had lots of little bones, but it didn't bother me to remove them as I ate the soup. I also made some rice which I added to the soup. ![yellow-croaker-soup](./img/yellow-croaker-soup.jpg) _Korean Yellow Croaker Soup_

Your food experimentation is fantastic :) (I've got 7 ferments on the go)  You make a great guinea pig ;) ... seafood is definitely an underutilized element in our N. American cuisine, and admittedly for many years, I never strayed beyond Salmon, Tuna and Shrimp/prawns ... but something happens when you cross over 30 and I'm becoming more adventerous ... the one pet peeve I have with fish is ... the bones! I wonder, can you cook them to the point of softness and much 'em in?

@canadian nomad - Not sure. This dish did have a lot of bones. My plan is to make this dish again with a different fish. Hopefully one with less bones.
