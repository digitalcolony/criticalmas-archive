I did a twist on my [Bacon Egg Cupcakes](/2011/07/bacon-egg-cupcakes/) by adding some chopped spinach and Mexican ricotta cheese. Yummy!

Sound great!  I loved the original recipe.
What is in Mexican ricotta?  I have never seen that.

@Darren - I believe it was called Requesón. Oddly enough, my Chinese grocery store carries a lot different Mexican cheeses. I'm trying a new one with each visit.
