Back in June, I posted [An Asian Alternative to Slow Cooked Pork](/2012/06/an-asian-alternative-to-slow-cooked-pork/). A few days ago I forgot about that recipe and made [Slow Cooker Sweet and Spicy Asian Pork Shoulder](http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/sweet-spicy-asian-pork-shoulder-00000000028082/index.html) from Real Simple, which is a little bit different. This one is more sweet and less spicy. If you make this recipe, I think you can reduce the soy sauce (or whatever substitute you use) by about 50%. I also didn't think adding sliced scallions upon serving made the dish any better, so you can eliminate that step. ![asian-pork](./img/asian-pork.jpg) Slow Cooker Sweet and Spicy Asian Pork Shoulder
