Back in January I posted [Pig Uterus Recipe: An Offal Idea](/2012/01/pig-uterus-recipe-an-offal-idea/).

> When I went to _Ranch 99_, I knew wanted a new kitchen challenge. Something that I never had before. Something exotic. When I saw the package of pork uterus, I hesitated for a moment and then threw it in the cart.

The rest of the post was how I attempted to make a curry using the pig uterus. The result was that I over cooked the uterus slightly and it had a rubbery taste. Still it didn't taste bad enough to prevent me from finishing the dish. In the comments, I got feedback that I needed to do a fast cook. I put off trying this dish until last night. Things didn't go well. I did the fast cook and it tasted awful. It smelled bad too. I can usually power through most dishes, but this one went into the trash. When it comes to cooking pig uterus, I'm going to surrender on this dish. If I see it at a restaurant I would try it just to know if it is possible to make this dish taste good. I'm skeptical. ![pig-uterus](./img/pig-uterus.jpg) _Onions, garlic, ginger, mushrooms and oyster sauce couldn't save this dish._

(._.) ummm. Uh-uh. 

Hi, MAS!! You're still awesome (as always), but this is freaking me out! That said, I'm sorry it didn't turn out delicious. Tasting or looking :]

Good luck finding this in a restaurant.

For over 20 years I've been searching out the earthiest restaurants in France and have never seen uterus on the menu - yes pig's ears, feet, liver, snout - but never uterus. Haven't seen pig's testicles either - but I have seen (and eaten) lamb's testicles several times. 

This attempt was way, way, way out on the fringe, and I admire you for it MAS!

My guess is that you might find a recipe in some obscure regional Chinese cuisine, or perhaps Okinawa...

@Glenn - I agree. If I find this dish I will likely be somewhere in Asia, not the USA.

I'm proud of myself just for eating liver on a regular basis!

You gotta come over to Asia for this kinda thing.

I eat pig uterus, large/small intestines, brains, maw, brains...etc regularly here. My advice is leave the cooking to the pros. You gotta prepare them carefully before cooking, otherwise it's gonna stink.
