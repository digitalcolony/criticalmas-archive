I was poking around on _Kayotic Kitchen_ and I found a recipe for Slow-Cooked Bombay Potatoes. It was a great idea, but I didn't have any potatoes. What I did have was a lot of cauliflower. Instead of making a single dish, I loaded up my slow cooker and [made the dish in bulk](http://escapetheherdblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/it-pays-to-cook-in-bulk.html). Usually, I never would do a larger quantity the first time I make a dish, but I was fairly confident that it would turn out good. And it did.

Cauliflower cooks faster than potatoes, so this dish was done in just 2 hours. All slow cookers are different. Taste as you go and stop the cook when it has the texture you like.

I was proud of the dish but it needed some protein. So I threw in some sardines. [Sardines are super healthy](http://theprimalsexy.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/i-3-sardines/) provided they aren't soaked in soybean oil. They also mixed nicely with the spices. Just remember to drain the water before adding them to the cauliflower.

This recipe really makes me want to stock my spice cabinet.  And I'm loving the addition of sardines!

You lost me at "sardines" :-)
I like to toss cauliflower in a little olive oil, and curry powder then roast in the oven until it carmelizes....

Mmm sardines. To me, they seem like the perfect topping.

I was in Monterey recently where the sardine business used to boom, until they over-fished the waters and the industry died. I wonder why we all don't eat more sardines? They could be a little like truffles or caviar -- delicacies.

LOVE this recipe!

I just bought six packages of sardines tonight from Trader Joes for $2.49 each, a little pricey.(from Morocco) I like them the most and there skinless and boneless packed in olive oil. I eatem at lunch time at work. I will try the recipe but with something other then cauliflower, Im not a big fan of it.
