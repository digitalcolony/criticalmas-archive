A month ago I outlined all the food restrictions involved in a [low histamine diet](/2012/05/the-low-histamine-diet/). One of the no-no foods is vinegar, which is a sneaky food ingredient. I was just getting ready to load up the slow cooker with pork and BBQ sauce, when I realized that vinegar was in the sauce. I didn't want to go to the store, so I improvised. After going through every bottle in my kitchen, I discovered my oyster sauce had no vinegar in it. My dish would be Asian style.

I'm not going to post this in recipe format, because it was a version one that I'm sure could be improved upon. Basically, I lined the bottom of the crock pot with onions. Added the pork shoulder. Then I made a paste of the following:

-   diced ginger
-   diced garlic
-   oyster sauce
-   some chili powder
-   Chinese [5 Spice Powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-spice_powder)

I added that to the pork and mixed it up. Then I added some chicken stock and cooked it for 4 hours, with the first hour on high and the remainder on low. I served the dish on rice. It was excellent.

For an improvised version one, I'm quite proud of myself. And I was able to avoid vinegar and stay low histamine.

Sounds delicious.  I'll have to try this the next time I go for the crockpot.
