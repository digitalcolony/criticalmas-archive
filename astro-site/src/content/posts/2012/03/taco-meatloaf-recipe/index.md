After my success in creating a meatloaf recipe with gyro meat flavor, I decided to continue my research in [advanced meatloaf studies](/2012/03/meatloaf-economics/). This week I give you **The Taco Meatloaf**. A super simple recipe that yields a meatloaf that tastes like taco meat. Why would you make a meatloaf that tastes like taco meat instead of just taco meat? I'm glad you asked.

1.  1.  The least healthy part of a taco is the shell. Soft tacos use flour wrappers, which are full of gluten. Corn is better, but many brands are made with vegetable oil. The Ortega brand uses partially hydrogenated soybean oil. No thanks! Industrial seed oils are toxic.
    2.  It is easier to bake a 3-pound meatloaf than standing over a stove browning 3 pounds of ground meat.
    3.  Cooking protein slower and at a lower temperature is better for you. It produces fewer Advanced Glycation End Products.
    4.  I can eat a hunk of meatloaf while driving my car much easier than a fist full of taco meat. :)

**Summary**: _A meatloaf that tastes like taco meat._


#### Ingredients


1.  1.  -   3 pounds of ground beef
        -   1 large egg
        -   1 tablespoon of minced garlic
        -   1/3 onion, diced, dried on a paper towel
        -   3 Tablespoons of New Mexico Chili Powder\*
        -   1.5 Tablespoons of Mexican Oregano
        -   2 teaspoons of sea salt
        -   pepper


#### Instructions


1.  1.  1.  Preheat oven to 330 F.
        2.  In a large bowl mix every ingredient together thoroughly.
        3.  Place the mix into a baking pan. I like the larger Pyrex baking dishes.
        4.  Cook for 35-40 minutes (internal temp to 160 F).
        5.  Serve.

#### Quick notes


\* I used the New Mexican Chili Powder Blend from World Spice Merchants. It rocks. If you can't get this, do your best to find a replacement. Look for a brand that mixes peppers and cumin. Or if you are skilled in the spice arts, you can always make your own custom blend. Now for the toppings. Add cheese, sour cream, salsa, or guacamole to the finished meatloaf. Or eat it plain. Both ways are extremely tasty. Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 40 minutes Diet tags: Gluten free Culinary tradition: Mexican

I'm going to try this, I love Mexican food :-)  in keeping with your bread-free life... you could wrap this in lettuce in lieu of a taco shell!

Also, no fancy name for it, but I put shredded zucchini, and carrots in my meatloaf... or sometimes spinach or chard (kind a hunt through the fridge and see what I can find approach)

@Jenn - I've had mixed results with carrots. Seems a little goes a long way. I have experimented with kale and even seaweed. Nothing has jumped out me yet.

I like your idea for a lettuce wrap. Perfect for a meatloaf sandwich!  

When I left San Diego for Seattle, I quickly gave up on Mexican food. Now I am back and going it my way. :)

I can see what you mean about carrots... I just thought of a carrot ginger meatloaf... or using fennel with carrot.  I mostly add the veggies for nutritional value, not so much for taste--some of the veggie additives don't really do much one way or the other :-)

@Jenn - Last night I received a family meatloaf recipe that uses ginger. I'm going to make it next. 

One of my favorite side dishes for meatloaf is fermented veggies. For this Taco Meatloaf recipe, I'm thinking the Cortido Sauerkraut recipe would be perfect.

It's heresy, I know, but I like wrapping stuff like this in Nori seaweed...

@Glenn - After the Japanese nuclear accident, I bought 3 different kids of seaweed and added them to stews, curries and meatloaf. Kind of got out of the habit recently though.
