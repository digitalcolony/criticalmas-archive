Last month I created a meatball recipe that mimicked the taste of gyro meat in the post [My Gyro Obsession and The Meatball Solution](/2012/02/my-gyro-obsession-and-the-meatball-solution/). Well, I have taken the same principles and applied them to meatloaf for even better results. This is the best tasting meatloaf I've ever had. It tastes like just gyro meat. **Summary**: _A meatloaf that tastes like gyro meat._


#### Ingredients


-   2 pounds of ground beef
-   1 pound of ground lamb
-   1 large egg
-   1/3 onion, diced, dried on a paper towel
-   1 tablespoon of minced garlic
-   1 tablespoon of cumin
-   1/2 - 1 tablespoon of oregano
-   1/2 - 1 tablespoon of marjoram
-   1/2 - 1 tablespoon of ground rosemary
-   1/2 - 1 tablespoon of thyme
-   1/2 - 1 teaspoon sea salt
-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper


#### Instructions


1.  Preheat oven to 330 F.
2.  In a large bowl mix every ingredient together thoroughly.
3.  Place the mix into a baking pan. I like the larger Pyrex baking dishes.
4.  Heat for 35-40 minutes.
5.  Test internal temperature for 160 degrees.

#### Quick notes


I've made this recipe using all ground beef and it tastes great that way as well. To make it even better, add some [Tzatziki Sauce](https://kalynskitchen.com/worlds-best-tzatziki-sauce-recipe-greek/). Feta cheese and tomatoes too!

Sounds delish!  Try mixing in a little grass-fed beef liver next time and get a nice hit of Vitamin D. That's how I consume it...in meatloaf!

@Mark - Good idea. I used to do that before I developed a taste for beef liver by itself.

This is somewhat unrelated but it is about healthy food.  

Apparently Starbucks has a pilot store called Evolution that serves juice drinks in Bellevue, WA.  You write very well-written and unbiased opinions of coffee shops, I was wondering if reviewing this place is in the cards.

@Thomas - Yeah, I saw that Melissa Allison from the Seattle Times wrote a story about that juice place. I am not a juice drinker. I think slamming liquid fructose is hell on your liver, so I have zero interest in visiting the store. Thanks for the nice words.

@Sara - I tried something similar to that recently, only I swapped out the breadcrumbs for Potato buds to kept it gluten free. Plus it had ginger and jalapenos. Pretty good.
