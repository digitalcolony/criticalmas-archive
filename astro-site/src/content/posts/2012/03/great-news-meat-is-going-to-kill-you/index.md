_UPDATE August 2024: This post is so cringe to me now. I avoid red meat almost 100% now. I just came back to this post to fix a broken link._ 

This week my fellow Paleo bloggers went into DEFCON 1 mode when _the big health story_ hit the mainstream news. That story was _Daily serving of red meat raises the risk of cancer and heart disease_. Meat, particularly red meat, is a staple of the Paleo diet. Here are some responses to the health story:

[Don't Throw That Red Meat Away!](http://escapetheherdblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/dont-throw-that-red-meat-away.html) - Escape the Herd

[Red Meat: Part of a Healthy Diet?](https://robbwolf.com/2012/03/14/red-meat-part-healthy-diet/) - Robb Wolf


### What Me Worry?


To be honest, this story didn't cause me any concern. It made me happy. I'll explain why later. The reason the story didn't phase me at all is that I understand that the real cause of heart disease is most likely inflammation caused by a neolithic food (veggie oils, excessive fructose) and not something mammals have been eating since the dawn of time (see [Paleo 2.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20140528084905/http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2011/3/30/paleo-20-a-diet-manifesto.html) by Dr. Kurt Harris).

Pop nutrition scare stories don't work on me anymore.


### Embracing Nutritional Apathy


For a while, I was evangelical when it came to nutrition. [Not anymore](/2011/10/the-3-stages-of-paleo/). If someone asks me, I will happily share my nutritional journey, but I've quit wasting my energy on the non-receptiveness masses. Several months ago I reached out to a very good friend with a well-researched email connecting her health problems to gluten. The symptoms were classic. Instead of a _thank you_ or a follow-up discussion, I got unfriended on Facebook. Oh well, lesson learned.

I'm not going to lose anymore time trying to help people who aren't receptive. Even the people who are the closest to me. My blog is here for those who care to hear about what worked for me. So if someone tells me that meat will give me cancer, I'll respond by saying "_Maybe, you're right_".


### Why the_"Meat Is Going to Kill You"_ Story Made Me Happy


This story that upset so many Paleo folks is excellent news. Next week and maybe a little longer the scared sheeple will buy less red meat for fear they will drop dead from cancer or a heart attack. This means grocery stores will have an excess supply of beef and lamb. To prevent loss, they will mark down the price. While the doped masses are buying tofu and _Low-Fat Graham Crackers_ next week, I'll be stocking my freezer full of discount lamb.

Before I get a question about conventional versus grass-pastured meat, let me say that I strongly prefer grass-pastured, but if the price is right I will get lean cuts of conventional beef or lamb. For ground beef, I will only buy 100% grass pastured.
