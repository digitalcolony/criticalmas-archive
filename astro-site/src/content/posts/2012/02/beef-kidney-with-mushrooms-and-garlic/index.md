I just cooked beef kidney for the first time and it came out great. I decided not to look at other recipes and instead take my best ideas from cooking beef liver and apply them to the kidney. My plan worked! I enjoyed the flavor even more than beef liver.

Why would anyone want to eat beef kidney? Like beef liver, [kidney is very nutritious](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=beef+kidney).It is high in protein, Vitamin B12 and riboflavin (B2). Beef kidney is also cheap. I was able to buy a pound of 100% grass pastured beef kidney from my neighborhood farmers market for just $4. When it comes to organ meats, always seek out the highest quality.

Also this recipe is for beef kidney, it will absolutely work the same for beef liver.

#### Quick notes


Some organ meat recipes say to add a splash of red wine. You can do that. I've found water works too.

MAS,

I like the idea of including offal into the diet, but find the choices (like liver, kidney, etc...) to be unappetizing.  Do you encounter this, and if so, how did you overcome?

@Jim - I would say your first step is to grind them up and bury them in a chili or meatloaf. A little each time. You'll barely taste it.
