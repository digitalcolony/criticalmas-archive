MAS,
I'll be getting Nassim's and Tim's books.  Nassim, at his Web site, described antifragile as not just being able to withstand a stress, but actually improving from the stress--an interesting concept.  I picked up the 48 Laws a while back based on your recommendation, but was never able to get through it (actually one of the few books I've started but not finished).  So, I'll have to await your review of mastery before I try it. As for 4HC, I'm also interested to see how the book sells, in view of the B&amp;N boycott.

@Jim - I loved 48 Laws. I've read it probably 3 times now. I didn't read it like a normal book. I'd pick a chapter at a time. Same with his other books. 

I was unaware of a B&N boycott. My loyalty is with Amazon. I detest how B&N constantly nag you to sign up for their rewards program to get a fair price. Amazon has been very good to me as a customer and as an a affiliate. 

I will be reading and reviewing all 3 books. I still am behind on my reviews. This summer I read 2 amazing books and a a few very good ones.

Taleb is a genius and can't wait to read that one as well!   I'll await your review on 4-hour chef before getting that...

Thanks!

Through Art De Vany I was introduced to Nassim Taleb, Richard (free the animal).  Along the way I was linked to so many others, that's how I found this site.  Some I follow regularly others I dip into, amazing how word is spread on the internet about intelligent writers, all crafting their own way. Its all about communication, the internet is magical for those who like to read and share interests.

I'm a huge fan of Taleb and can't wait to see his latest work. I gather it touches on the benefits of hormesis and volatility, like how sprinting and intense lifting are more beneficial than steady-state cardio, or how intermittent fasting and feasting are superior to 3 square meals on a clockwork schedule. These are things I'm already inclined to believe, and I'm curious to see what he does with it.

Ferris I'm less excited about, as he has always come across to me as a bit of a used-car salesman. He works hard to manufacture a certain image of himself, and it's impossible to read one of his books without wading through hundreds of reminders of what a multi-talented pioneering jetsetter Tim Ferris (tm) is.

In a blog post today, Ferriss writes "The best treatment of apprenticeship I’ve ever found is in Mastery, the latest book by Robert Greene ... .  It’s one of the few books I made time to read cover-to-cover in the last few months."

Tim Ferriss is a nut jockey.
