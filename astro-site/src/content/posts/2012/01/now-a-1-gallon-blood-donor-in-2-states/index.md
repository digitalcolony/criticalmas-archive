Yesterday, I collected my 1 Gallon Donor pin after donating my 8th pint of premium grade B Positive. Now some lucky chap will soon have [pig uterus](/2012/01/pig-uterus-recipe-an-offal-idea/) coursing through his veins. Back in my Florida days, I donated a full gallon to that state. I like being able to help my fellow neighbors by donating blood. Either that or I'm doing it for [selfish reasons](/2010/06/the-selfish-case-for-donating-blood/). ;)
