For the past few years I have been reading the fitness blog [Conditioning Research](https://conditioningresearch.blogspot.com/) by Chris Highcock. Although I would be hard pressed to name a favorite nutrition blog, I can easily say _Conditioning Research_ is the best fitness blog. When I started reading the site, I had yet to be convinced on the effectiveness of High Intensity Training. I was still in the [Pavel](/2011/03/power-people-10-years/) camp of low reps, high weight and high rest between sets. My progress had stalled and I was ready to try something different.

It was Chris Highcock who convinced me to give High Intensity Training a try. Not directly though. I saw he shared the same opinion that I did on many other health-related topics. Maybe Chris was on to something with this High Intensity Training? So a little over a year ago I went all in with HIT and haven't looked back. **High Intensity Training is a highly effective and safe method for developing strength in minimal time.** I refer to High Intensity Training as the [espresso of weight training](/2011/06/high-intensity-exercise-is-the-espresso-of-weight-training/).

In November, I left my gym and took my High Intensity workouts outdoors using bodyweight exercises. I describe my current workout in the post [Escaping the Glitter: Taking High Intensity Training Outdoors](/2011/11/escaping-the-glitter-taking-high-intensity-training-outdoors/). Although I am proud of this post, it probably is not that useful to someone new to the HIT concept. They will need guided instructions, photos, and background information to help them get started on constructing their own High Intensity Training program. That is exactly what _Hillfit: Strength_ by Chris Highcock does.

The 52-page _Hillfit_ e-book is the most user-friendly introduction I have seen to High Intensity Training. All the exercises in the _Hillfit: Strength_ program can be done from home without purchasing any equipment. Although the book's title and early pages suggest the audience is for hiking, the reality is that developing strength will benefit you no matter what your sport happens to be. Even if your sport is playing with your kids. I highly recommend Hillfit: Strength as an introduction to High Intensity Training.

**UPDATE APRIL 2013:** Version [2.0 of Hillfit](/2013/07/hillfit-2-0-a-zero-budget-approach-to-high-intensity-training/) is now available.

_Disclosure: I received a copy of Hillfit in exchange for feedback on a draft version._

UPDATE 2024: Hillfit is now back online and available for [free download](https://github.com/Hillfit) on GitHub.

I'm a fan of traditional strength training techniques, but you can't beat HIT training when it comes to training both strength and cardio in a short amount of time.  Thanks for the tip on the e-book.

Why Hillfit as opposed to Body by Science? Looking to try out HIT training and wondering which to start with.

@Sameer - I like both Hillfit and Body by Science. I say get them both. If you are already paying for a gym membership, get BBS. If you want to do it yourself at home, get Hillfit.
