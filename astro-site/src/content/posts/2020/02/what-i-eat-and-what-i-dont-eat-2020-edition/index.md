It has been 3 years since the [last edition](/2017/01/eat-dont-eat-2017-edition/) of this post series.

I started this post in June 2019, but I was changing things up, so I delayed. Then I made more and more changes. I feel I'm settled for now.

There were three big changes to my diet:

1.  The movement towards lower fat, higher protein, and higher carbs.
2.  Back to being strict Gluten Free. I didn't want to go here, but my hand was forced. See the post [Gluten / Wheat – Just When I Thought I Was Out…](/2019/09/gluten-wheat-just-when-i-thought-i-was-out/) for details.
3.  Drastic reduction in dairy and meat consumption. It started as an experiment. See the post [Listening to the Smartest Vegans](/2019/06/listening-to-the-smartest-vegans/) for details. But as the experiment went further, I not only felt better without the meat, but I lost my appetite to consume most meat.


### 90% Pesco-Vegan (almost)


Some of you may recall I was a pesco-vegetarian for many years. See the timeline [here](/2008/07/im-not-a-vegetarian/). I did pretty well. I was healthy. I gained some muscle. In hindsight, I can now see I probably carried an extra 10-15 pounds I didn't need. Like many vegetarians, I consumed a lot of calories in the form of dairy.

Now I have no issue with dairy. 23andMe says I am 99.8% European. But last year I listened to the vegans' argument against dairy. Two points they made were that dairy was inflammatory and that it was full of estrogen. Now, I don't know if either is true. But, I'll try anything if it helps speed up my recovery times between workouts. Even if it means ditching the ice cream and cheese.

What happened? Two things. First, I did notice a gradual improvement in recovery times. Second, I lost weight. I went from a stable 192-194 to 185-187. _(height = 6'2.5)_ The last time I was this lean, I felt I looked too thin. I covered this in the post [You Look Too Thin](/2020/01/you-look-too-thin/). Part of that was being tired and wearing baggy clothes. But a small part might be my skin looked better. I did get a few compliments on my complexion. Many people report better skin after dropping dairy.

I also dropped a lot of meat. Part of the reason was I no longer felt confident that my Paleo mentors were right about saturated fat. See the post [Saturated Fat Revisited](/2019/12/saturated-fat-revisited/) for details. I have another reason, which I will explore in a future post after I've done more research.

Maybe once a month, I'll eat lamb. I'll likely have turkey a few times a year. If I get a chance to have an ostrich or buffalo burger, I'll take it.


### My Avoid List


-   Gluten food
-   Most meat, most of the time. I do [supplement with beef liver/organ capsules](/2019/08/spiking-iron-levels-quickly-with-beef-organ-capsules/) before and after donating blood.
-   Most dairy, most of the time. The exception is fat-free Greek yogurt. If butter sneaks into a dish, that is OK.
-   Sugar drinks (diet drinks too). Flavored waters like La Croix are all I need.
-   Alcohol. Not my choice. I just can't process alcohol without getting a near-instant sinus headache. At most, I can handle 2 oz of cider and sometimes not even that.
-   Fried food
-   Cooking with oil, most of the time. Seed oils are out. From time to time, I might use EVOO, but usually, I don't cook in a pan, but if I did I might just use water. Boiling, baking, and pressure cooking are my preferred cooking methods. I also keep this rule in mind when ordering at a restaurant. Of course, I'm not perfect, but I do my best.


### Staples


Although all healthy food is fair game, here are my current staples.

-   Oatmeal. Both regular and steel-cut. Soaked with chia seeds.
-   Buckwheat and Quinoa
-   Potatoes. Purple potatoes are my new favorite.
-   All fruit and veggies. Apples are my favorite, especially all the new varietals.
-   Sardines in water or olive oil. I drain most of the olive oil.
-   Lentils and legumes.
-   Rice. Brown when I'm out. White at home. _(My rice cooker is painfully slow cooking brown rice.)_
-   Nuts and seeds. Almonds and sesame seeds mostly. When you cut out most of your meat and dairy, you need calories from somewhere. This is the easiest place to get them.
-   Pastured Eggs. Maybe not a staple, but perhaps 1 dozen a month. Definitely not the dozen a week I used to consume.
-   Superfood powders. Chlorella, Spirulina, Amla, etc.
-   Flaxseeds. (I keep them refrigerated and then grind before eating.)
-   Frozen fruit bars. I replaced ice cream with frozen fruit bars. They have far fewer calories and are a great cold treat for me.


### After The Peasant Diet


I touched on this before, but I used the [Peasant Diet](/2017/09/used-peasant-diet-lean/) to lean out. And then I used the Peasant Diet to maintain the weight loss for more than a year. After that, I started embracing higher quality and more diverse foods. It was my reward for the struggle. A Peasant works toward a better future. I made it there.

I don't limit my calories with the food choices listed above. I don't need to. Once you get rid of the calorie-dense foods, keeping lean is easy.

Seems like a very reasonable WFPB diet with some exceptions.

Out of curiosity - can you tell whether these super-food powders make a difference? Are they that beneficial if one follows an all around nutritious diet?

@Marcin - I don't know those answers. But I think of these steps as insurance that I'm getting all my nutrient needs. It also reconnects me to my initial motivation on nutrition which I posted about back in 2008.

https://criticalmas.org/2008/03/150-superfoods-because-14-just-wasnt-enough/

The book How Not to Die makes a case for loading up on foods rich in antioxidants, so I figured I'd give it a go. I can't tell if I'm better for it. But it keeps me focused on seeking out nutritional density.

Looking forward to your further reasons for less meat, not sure why but it fascinates me. I have been trying to do a mostly peasant diet and the weirdest thing I have noticed is that I don't crave giant steaks anymore, or any meats to be honest. And I'm usually a fiend for a 1.2kg T-bone reverse seared over charcoal. My butcher will go broke! Thanks for the update Mas

How much protein and fat do you consume a day?

@Be z - I don't count. My diet is higher carb and low-fat though.

So you do not mind PUFA in nuts and seeds? I want to build up my diet better, mostly because lot of struggle with digestion. I am not gaining any weight, i was skinny all my life, but when I try to eat high palatable caloric foods to gain, digestion problems will show up. I think there is no difference between skinny or fat people. We all have problems, some gain weight easily, some have digestion issues, some psychological issues. I think it is somehow dopamine-serotonine connected. For example when I would eat ice cream, I would have great mood, but my stomach would hurt after while. But when I would eat some apples and then ghee when getting same macros, my stomach would be OK, but i would still crave that ice cream. That is IMO reason why potato diet work- not only by caloric restriction, but also by avoiding dopamine spikes and then building better dopamine baseline. My question is- how to replace animal fats to still get plenty of calories and not spike dopamine too much when I want to avoid PUFA constumption related problems? (Cause eating ghee alone is hardcore and awful).

@Samson - My view of PUFA in nuts is in this 2014 post:
https://criticalmas.org/2014/08/nuts-pufa-vitamin-e/

Since this post, I have cut back on nuts and seeds again. I needed calories from the decline in dairy calories. I've added back some low-fat and no-fat dairy. Most greek yogurt.

Can you consume coconut cream? High in calories with zero PUFA.
