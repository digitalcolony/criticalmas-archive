On the show Seinfeld, George pledged to read a book during his time off.

> George: I'm really going to do something with these three months. Jerry: Like what? George: I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.

I'm pleased to say I've met the Costanza Challenge. Here are the non-computer books that I've read since May 5th. **Unexpected Returns: Understanding Secular Stock Market Cycles** by Ed Easterling. I learned why it's difficult it is to make money in a secular bear market. Covers absolute returns vs relative returns. Excellent economic history. **Snowblind: A Brief Career in the Cocaine Trade** by Robert Sabbag. Smuggling cocaine in the 1970s on a much smaller scale than the movie/book Blow. **Beyond Bodybuilding** by Pavel. Not the landmark book Power to the People was. Book is mostly a collection of article reprints from the old Muscle Media magazine. **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion** by Robert B. Cialdini. An outstanding book that exposes business psychology and how we as humans are programmed to fall for the techniques of marketers. I wish I'd read this a decade ago. **Atlas: From the Streets to the Ring: A Son's Struggle to Become a Man** by Teddy Atlas. This is the autobiography of boxing genius Teddy Atlas. **The 33 Strategies of War** by Robert Greene. Another brilliant collection of wisdom from the writer that gave us The 48 Laws of Power.
