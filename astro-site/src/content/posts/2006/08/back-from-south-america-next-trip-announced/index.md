Hope you missed me, I'm back in America. The last 3 weeks I was in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. And I even made a surprise unplanned trip to Paraguay. In the next 2 days, I plan to have the trip details and photo galleries completed.

Why the rush? Friday I head off on a 10 day trip to the North Island of New Zealand. The Summer of George continues.

> No group this time. Old school planning with travel books. I'll comment more on when to use groups when I do the South America overview.

> Welcome back! SanDiegoBlog missed you... Did you make to Patagonia?? I spent 6 weeks in Argentina, from BA on south, and over to Bariloche as well. Beautiful country.

MAS

> Just BA. Perhaps I'll hit Patagonia sometime in the future.

> I am always surprised how people thing it is so cost prohibitive to travel... I went to Argentina on a Rotary Group Study Exchange scholarship, and travelled for 2 months in Europe by working 2 jobs for a year so I could save money. Other smaller trips have been financed by not spending money on a lot of things that other people spend a lot of money on-- even shopping at Marshall's or TJ Maxx adds up, it's just $15 dollars at a time.

> its not the cost... how do you take 3 consecutive weeks off from your job?

MAS
