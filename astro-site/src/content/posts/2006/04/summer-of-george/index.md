Today I gave 2 weeks' notice to my employer. I have been at the same job since January 2002. It's time for a change. I don't have a new job waiting for me. At this time I don't want or need one. This will be my Summer of George!

> George: Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing. Jerry: They did it for three years. What's another few months. George: I'm really going to do something with these three months. Jerry: Like what? George: I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order. Jerry: I've always wanted to do that... George: I'm gonna play frolf. Jerry: You mean golf? George: Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George!
