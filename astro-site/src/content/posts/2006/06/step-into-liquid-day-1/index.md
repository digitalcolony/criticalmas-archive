Today I took my 2 hour surfing lesson at the [Eli Howard Surf School](https://www.elihoward.com/). It went much better than my snowboarding experience. I rode several waves to shore on the long foam surfboard provided by the school.

I don't have any photos of my first day of surfing, so go to Laird Hamilton's website and check out his photos. We're both 6'3 and 215 pounds. Should be close enough. Right?
