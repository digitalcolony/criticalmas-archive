The most overused and inaccurate phrase used today is: _I'm so busy_. Let me just say: _No you're not_.

We all know someone who is always telling us how busy they are. What they are saying is they have poor time management skills, but still find time to brag about their ineffectiveness.

The people who are truly busy don't have time to tell you how busy they are.

I make it a point to never use the _busy_ word. In most situations it is easier to take additional action to a conclusion than to shut people down with the _I'm so busy_ routine.
