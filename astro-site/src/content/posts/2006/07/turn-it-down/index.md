Why must downtown living be so loud? I miss the peace and quiet of the [exburb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exburb) of the San Pasqual Valley. While I've gotten used to the sound of the train and street cleaner, there are some sounds that annoy me daily. 1-Cars with Loud Stereos 2-Car Alarms 3-Some Motorcycles Today I came up with a solution in the spirit of the _[red light cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road-rule_enforcement_camera)_. Throughout the city we set up audio cameras which measure the decibel level coming from a car. If the decibel level is high enough, the camera snaps a photo of the license plate and the person is sent a fine in the mail. Of course a single offense wouldn't cause a fine, but a pattern of offenses would. There would a higher daytime decibel allowance and a lower nighttime one. Overtime life would get quieter. Are you with me? Or should I move back to the sticks? On a side note, I ask this question on occasion: If the [DC snipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_sniper) had only shot punks with booming car stereos would they still be considered terrorists or would they be heroes? You can guess where I stand. **Legacy Comments** Joe

> When we lived in Sherman Heights we'd get people on their way to get on the 163 or the 94 with their BUMPING WINDOW RATTLING BASS on their idiotmobiles. It's a friggin residential area, chill out with the 50-Cent treatment!! I totally wanted to employ some sort of powerful electromagnetic device to screw with their stupid speakers rattling the creaky house and freaking us and the cat out!

> The extreme volume is what makes me think of the DC snipers. They wouldn't even hear shots.
