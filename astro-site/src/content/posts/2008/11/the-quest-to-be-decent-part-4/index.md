No milestones today. I thought for sure I was going to nail _Good_ status on the pull-ups. Nope.

1.  **Pull-Ups** - I needed 20 to move from _Decent_ to _Good_. I got 17, which is a new personal record, but still 3 shy of _Good_. Darn high-reps! I have set a new goal to do a 100 pound weighted pull-up sometime in 2009. I might have to get [MacGyver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) with the equipment at my Glitter Gym to pull that off. :)
2.  **Leg Press** - Last week I started this exercise with 135 and 185. No soreness, so this week I did 225 and 275. Slow and steady.
3.  **EZ Bicep Curl** - In [Part 2](/2008/11/the-quest-to-be-decent-part-2/), I speculated that with my tiny wrists I would probably never get a _Good_ score of 135 pounds. Today I raised my poundage to 100. Who knows, maybe _Good_ is possible?
4.  **Monster Moves** - I'm going to refer to the squat, dead lift and bent rows as the monster moves. They all take place in the cage and like a monster, they tend to be loud. These are the ones I need to go slow and steady or I'll get injured. Progress here will take months, not weeks. And being injury free is more important to me than being _Decent_.

My 2008 Training Scorecard remains at 7/12 _Decent_.
