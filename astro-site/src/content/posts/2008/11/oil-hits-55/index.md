A year ago, it seemed that everyone thought oil prices would continue to rise. I heard predictions for $200 and even $300 a barrel. Who would have guessed one year ago that oil would be down to $55? That would be me.

From my 2008 Predictions post on _MarketTicker_ on 12/27/2007:

> OIL = $55 President Mitt

Although I was wrong about Romney winning the 2008 election, I accurately predicted that oil would reach $55 by the end of 2008. This calls for a celebration dance.

I promise not to bring out the dancing banana until the S&P 500 hits 600 or Paulson is lynched. Whichever comes first.

gas here in NM is UNDER $2 / gallon at a couple of stations. cRAzY

and since I only drive about 15 miles per week, it doesn't much matter to me anyway.  

now if the price shoes goes up significantly I may be affected....

I see how tiny that island looks on a map.  Are you sure you need a car?  Couldn't you long jump it?  :)
