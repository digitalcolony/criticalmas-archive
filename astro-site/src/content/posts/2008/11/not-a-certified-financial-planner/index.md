Since I have quite a few posts on investing, I thought it was appropriate that I add a disclaimer. **I am not a Certified Financial Planner.** I'm just a regular Joe with an interest in economics. Although I have a Finance degree from the diploma mill known as _The Ohio State University_, everything that I apply to investing today was knowledge obtained since 2004. ![](./img/21-300x294.jpg "MAS money") No post on this site shall be construed as investment advice. This site is about me. I invest. Therefore I blog about investing. I know my risk tolerance and how much time and effort I am willing to devote to investing. What works for me, may not work for you. I will continue to [trash the advice](/2008/04/mr-financial-planner-go-home-and-get-your-shine-box/) of certified financial planners as they continue to peddle the [industry lie](/2008/03/investing-in-stocks-for-the-long-term/). As my friend Mattwould say - _**don't invest in anything you don't understand**_. That especially includes the stock market. Knowing what you don't know is the most liberating thing about investing. When professionals try and convince you that they know, you should be skeptical. That is all.

Man.  I REALLY want to keep fighting with you over this idea of an Industry Lie, but I'd be breaking my vow of no more arguing about finance.

Nice chart here.

Green = buy stocks
Red = fixed income

MAS = now is Red
Certified Financial Planner = it is always Green

Diploma mill of Ohio State University?  That hurts, man--that cuts deep.  Sure, it's a huge university and by it's very size issues a lot of diploma's.  But I'd hardly call it a diploma mill.

More on topic though, I agree with the general theme of your post.  I'd also comment that it's pretty obvious we're in a red phase right now.  But the vast majority of the time it's much harder to know for certain.  That doesn't make the financial planners right of course.
