Yesterday I outlined my [Quest To Be Decent](/2008/11/the-quest-to-be-decent-begins/). Today I tackled four more exercises.

1.  **EZ Bicep Curl** - Since I take a functional approach to weight lifting I rarely do direct arm work, but I knew I'd easily get a _Decent_ score on this exercise. Sure enough I nailed 90 for reps. No problem. A _Good_ score is 135 pounds. Don't know if that is going to happen with my tiny wrists.
2.  **Pull-Ups** - I'm Mr. Low Rep, so maxing out on my favorite exercise is new territory. I'd rather strap on a [weight belt and plate](/2008/09/250-pound-pull-up/) than go beyond 5 reps. I already have a _Decent_ score, so I think this will be my first _Good_ score. Today I did another 15. I should have 20 reps by the end of the year.
3.  **Bent Rows** - Back in my home gym days, I used to do this exercise all the time. These days I've been doing 1-arm dumbbell rows with 110 pounds (that is where my Glitter Gym tops out at). Since I haven't done a barbell row in a long time, I just did 3 sets of 5 with 135.
4.  **Leg Press** - This is an asinine exercise that I would never do unless it was listed in the article. I suppose if one was ever buried the rubble of an earthquake they might get an opportunity to push silly amounts of weight with their leg muscles. I followed my new exercise rule and did two low rep sets using 135 and 185.

My 2008 Training Scorecard so far is 6/12 _Decent_ or 50%. I expect Dips will be my next _Decent_ milestone.

*gulp*  The leg press is my favorite exercise. Ever.  Why is it asinine??

You know me.  I'm a big fan of compound functional movements.  It is easy to lift an insane amount of weight isolating just the leg muscles.   The surrounding muscles don't get a bit stronger and the strength gains don't carry over.  I believe strength imbalances often turn into injury.

Do a single body weight squat and hold it with perfect posture for a full minute.  It is tougher and more humbling than leg pressing hundreds of pounds.
