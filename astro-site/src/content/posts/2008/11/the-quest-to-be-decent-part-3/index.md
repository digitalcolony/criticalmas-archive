As predicted in [Part 2](/2008/11/the-quest-to-be-decent-part-2/), I nailed the Dips. I focused on three exercises today.

1.  **Dips** - Have I mentioned how much I loathe high repetition training? But I really want to be _Decent_, so I needed to hit 20 reps. After completing the 20 reps, I grabbed a weight belt and resumed my low-rep weighted dips.
2.  **Bench Press** - My only _Decent_ bench press was back in May 2007. I'm more of a incline dumbbell guy, so I'm just starting to revisit the classic flat barbell bench press. Today I benched my weight (200) for 3 reps. Since I work out in a Glitter Gym, it will be tough finding someone to spot me as I approach 225.
3.  **Skull Crusher** - Added 5 more pounds to this ridiculous exercise. I've already hit _Decent_ and think that _Good_ is possible by spring.

My 2008 Training Scorecard is now 7/12 _Decent_. Looking at the table I'm guessing it will be several weeks before I hit another _Decent_ milestone. However, my first _Good_ score is within reach on the Pull-Ups.

Hey Michael, are you sure you want to continue to do these exercises you loathe, find ridiculous or decide whether you are strong by someone else's rules?  Is it a satisfaction initiative?

It is a Quest, it shouldn't be easy or comfortable.  

Most of the exercises I have no problem with.  I diss high-rep training, but doing every now and then isn't going to hurt me.  

The only 2 exercises I'm concerned about are the squat and deadlift.  My back injury of 2007 still haunts me.  I will take these very slowly and not sacrifice safety.
