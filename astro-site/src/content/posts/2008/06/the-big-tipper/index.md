Went to get my haircut today and the lady that cuts my hair was telling me how she was able to send money to [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar#Cyclone_Nargis) because of the _big tip_ from my previous haircut. Before she started telling me about how they got the money into the damaged village, I stopped her and explained that I always tip $5 on a $15 haircut. She cuts hair for mostly old guys and I knew some tipped very little or not at all, but a $5 tip shouldn't result in sending money for a relief effort. Then she corrected me. Turns out that I had reached for a $20 bill and instead gave her a $50 bill. I handed it to her and walked out. _Keep the change._ I did find it odd that she asked me multiple times if I was sure I wanted to give her such a big tip. Thinking it was just $5 and feeling sorry so many old people stiff her all day long, I smiled at her, waved and left. I usually never carry $50 bills, but I had just sold something on Craigslist and was cash heavy that day. I wonder how much good came out of the accidental tip. I didn't even notice the shortfall. ![](./img/mynmar.jpg) _Photo by Flickr user TZA_
