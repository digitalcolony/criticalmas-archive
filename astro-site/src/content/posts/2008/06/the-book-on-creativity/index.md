If you are looking for guidance and direction with the creative process, I have a book recommendation. ![A Whack on the Side of the Head: How You Can Be More Creative](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xdftTaBfL.jpg) A Whack on the Side of the Head: How You Can Be More Creative by Roger von Oech can be divided into three sections. The first part provides ten rules that are to be broken to stimulate creativity. The second part reminds us to assume the role of the Warrior and take action with our new ideas. The last section covers 30 gems of wisdom from [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus) with an applicable modern interpretation from the author. The book is an easy read but is packed with wisdom.
