How many times have I moved in the last 20 years? Let us count.

1988 - 1994 - The Ohio State era (7) 1994 - 1998 - Tampa Bay era (4) 1998 - 2000 - DC Metro era (2) 2000 - 2007 - San Diego era (3) 2007 - present - Seattle era (2)

My address total is 18 over the last 20 years. Although I'm fortunate to have lived in the Mid-West, Mid-Atlantic, South Florida, Southern California and the Pacific Northwest, it would be nice to establish roots someday.
