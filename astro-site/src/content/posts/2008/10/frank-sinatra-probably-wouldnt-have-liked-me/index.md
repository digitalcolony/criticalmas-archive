I first read this book about 10 years ago and I really enjoyed reading it again.

![The Way You Wear Your Hat: Frank Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin'](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PZTWB0ENL._SL500_.gif) _The Way You Wear Your Hat: Frank Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin' by Bill Zehme_ is not a typical biography. Instead of chronicling life from birth to death, the author created a manual on how to live life according to Frank Sinatra. The reason I titled the post as such is that Frank loved to stay out late and booze it up. A light-weight like myself with an [early bedtime](/2008/08/i-dont-like-the-nightlife-id-rather-be-lean/) would draw scorn from the Chairman of the Board.

The book is full of stories and the chapters are broken down by topic. Topics include Pallies, Broads, Booze, Style, Love & Marriage, and My Way. Although I can't seem to learn how to stay awake at night, the book had great lessons on friendship and being a gentleman.

I would sell my left nut if I could go back and be a part of his crew.  

This just might get me to start reading again!  :-)

This book is an easy read.  You can also read it in any order you like.  It also has many great photos.
