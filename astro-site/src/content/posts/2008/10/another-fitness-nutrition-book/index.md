I keep stumbling on the name Paul Chek when reading fitness articles, so I decided to read his book. ![How to Eat, Move and Be Healthy!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41B19Prj%2BsL._SL500_.jpg) How to Eat, Move and Be Healthy! by Paul Chek was very nicely edited. The book is colorful with lots of helpful drawings explaining exercises and nutrition. Overall I thought this was a good book. Most of the stuff I had learned before, but the collection of information was very well done. Paul has some very entertaining videos on YouTube. He has a no-nonsense balanced approach to fitness.
