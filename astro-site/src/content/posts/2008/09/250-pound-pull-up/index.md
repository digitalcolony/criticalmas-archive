Long arms and small wrists make pull-ups a challenge, which is exactly why I do them. After years of not progressing past the 5x5 body weight pull-ups, I decided to grab a belt to see what I was capable of. I'm only a week into weighted pull-ups, but I was able to strap in 50 pounds for 2 reps today (I weight 200). Yeah Buddy! Here is a video of a guy doing a 305 pound weighted pull-up (190 pound body weight + 115 pounds).
