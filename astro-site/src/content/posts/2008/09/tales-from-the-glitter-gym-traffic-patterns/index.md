I love football season. No, I don't actually waste my weekends watching other men exercise while consuming empty carbohydrates in a semi-drunken state. The reason I like football season is because it has the same predictable effect on Glitter Gym traffic patterns. When football season starts, people stop going to the gym. _Grab the chips and beer._ This works out for me, since I now have the equipment to myself. From now until New Years, I won't have to bump elbows with the untrained masses. January they will return for a few weeks until they give up on their New Years resolutions. Then right before spring, they will return in a mad dash to _lean out_ before they shed their coats for the warmer weather. ![gym](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/40/84616649_e0bb503299_z.jpg?zz=1) _[Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/73266756@N00/84616649/) by Girl.in.the.D_ So predictable. Every year it is the same pattern. The only exception is women will often return to the gym just prior to Thanksgiving. Perhaps a last ditch desire to look good in front of friends and family. Men will just throw on an over-sized jersey with their favorite football player's name on the back. Works for me.
