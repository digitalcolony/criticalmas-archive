I just finished emptying my camera of more Seattle snow photos. I've hiked almost 50 miles around Seattle since the snow began. This is my idea of taking a week off from lifting weights. ![snow-2](./img/snow-2.jpg) ![snow-1](./img/snow-1.jpg) ![snow-3](./img/snow-3.jpg) Look at the above photo. That is my street! YouTube is being flooded with videos of people skiing, sledding, snowboarding and tubing down my hill. User [caseyengler81](http://www.youtube.com/user/caseyengler81) made four short videos of people heading down Queen Anne Ave (aka The Counterbalance). A block over, I made a 9 second video of someone attempting to sled down from the top of Kerry Park: [Sledding Down Kerry Park in Seattle](http://youtu.be/MYVKYlTJTgw).
