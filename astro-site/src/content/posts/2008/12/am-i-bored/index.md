Recently, a friend of mine told me that I must be bored. He couldn't wrap his head around the idea of not going into the office everyday. In the absence of a boss dictating requirements does boredom eventually set in? Not for me. ![vancouver-aquarium](./img/vancouver-aquarium.jpg) _This summer I drove up to Vancouver, visited friends and went to an aquarium. Didn't need to request time off to the boss. I just went._ I have lots of interests and many projects that I'm either working on or planning to work on in the near future. Surrendering my life to a commute and an office building is not something I'm interested in doing at this time. I simply have too many things I want to do. Will I ever rejoin the cubicle posse? Anything is possible, but it won't be anytime soon. A new job would would have to meet my [4 requirements of a great job](/2007/02/the-meaning-of-work/) or I wouldn't consider it. As for now, I have savings, no debt and [my investment thesis](/2008/10/picking-a-new-sp-500-target/) is unfolding. I don't need a W-4.

I just read your post and also went back to the one where you named the requirements for a great job and the congratulations from others for leaving a boring job. I was attracted to your post because "bored" was in the title but I see you are far from bored. My blog ThePowerOfBoredom.com is just as much the power of interest and all the elements that make up interest such as you mentioned: meaningfulness, etc. 

You say your friends, some of them, can't get their heads around not having a boss or requirements to  keep them occupied...independence sounds like boredom to them. Far from it; only freedom allows you to shape your life to fulfill your interests, but you have to shape your life to get that freedom. You've done it. Check out ThePowerOfBoredom.com and see what you think.
