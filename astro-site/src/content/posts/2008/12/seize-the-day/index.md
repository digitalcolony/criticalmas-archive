Over seven years ago, I received an article submission for INeedCoffee by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/). He wrote a profile on author and coffee fan [Saul Bellow](https://ineedcoffee.com/saul-bellow-coffee-achiever/). I decided that _one of these days_ I was going to get around to reading a book by Saul Bellow. That day finally came.

![Seize the Day (Penguin Classics)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41m8pu8zfYL.jpg) _Seize the Day (Penguin Classics) by Saul Bellow_ is a classic short story. At only 114 pages it was perfect for me to take a break away from my usual non-fiction reading selections. The book told the story of a man that let blame, resentment, fear and anger destroy his thinking and his life. Good story.

..and a great case for reading "The Secret" (even though you called this the worst book of the year in 2007 :)  ) and Wayne Dyer's "The Power of Intention".
