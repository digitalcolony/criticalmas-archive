One of the writers over on _T-Nation_ wrote a book recently on a weight training subtopic that I was interested in learning more about.

![Maximum Strength: Get Your Strongest Body in 16 Weeks with the Ultimate Weight-Training Program](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BaEv07apL.jpg) _Maximum Strength: Get Your Strongest Body in 16 Weeks with the Ultimate Weight-Training Program by Eric Cressey_ is a strength training book written at my level. It is not a _dumbed-down_ book for the first time weight lifter.

I bought this book so I could learn more about using foam rollers properly for soft tissue work. This is the first book I am aware of that developed a foam roller warm-up plan for the strength athlete. After many years of lifting weights, I can tell my limiting factor is stiffness that is only partially alleviated with stretching and deep tissue massage. I look forward to trying the exercises.

The actual strength plan described on the cover appears to be solid. There are some exercises described in the book, which I've never done before. One of my golden rules in the gym is when you first do new exercises, do two sets of low reps at a low weight, and then don't repeat that exercise for a full week. This is a safe way to introduce your body to new movements. It'll probably take me a month or so to learn the new exercises. At that point, I can confidently start the 16-week program.

Unlike other book reviews I've done, I won't know how good this book is for me for a few months. However, I really did enjoy the first read and hope the soft tissue work will make me stronger (aka decent) in 2009.
