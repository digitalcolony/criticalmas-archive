Just like I did in [2007](/2007/12/best-books-for-2007/), soon I'll be assembling my Best Books of 2008 list. I'm almost certain this one will make the list.

![Smile When You're Lying: Confessions of a Rogue Travel Writer](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/11kqoVWVDlL.jpg) _Smile When You're Lying: Confessions of a Rogue Travel Writer by Chuck Thompson_ is a very funny travel book. The author trashes the travel writing industry and then tells a series of stories that you would never read while researching a trip. Great stories and a fun read. Highly recommended.
