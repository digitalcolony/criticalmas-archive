This year I polished off about 60 books. A new record for me. Most of the books were not written in 2008, so my _"best of"_ list for the year just refers to when I got around to reading it. This year I decided to break the list into four groups. **Finance**

1.  [Fooled By Randomness](/2008/03/fooled-by-randomness/) - Understand survivorship bias and you'll never look at the world the same.
2.  [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](/2008/04/reminiscences-of-a-stock-operator/) - Investor classic from the 1920s. If you make more than a few stock trades a week, this is a must read.
3.  [The Origins of the Crash](/2008/02/the-origins-of-the-crash/) - Not only does regular history repeat itself, so does financial history. This is the definitive book on the greatest bull market in history and all the fraud along the way.

**Food and Fitness**

1.  [The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth](/2008/03/150-superfoods-because-14-just-wasnt-enough/) - The easiest way to lose fat is to fall in love with healthy food. This book should be in every kitchen. Share it with your family.
2.  [Mindless Eating](/2008/05/mindless-eating/) - The psychology of eating. Learn how to overcome your biology to get lean.
3.  [In Defense of Food](/2008/07/in-defense-of-food/) - Don't be a slave to the so-called nutritional experts.

**Funny**

1.  [Smile When You're Lying](/2008/12/smile-when-youre-lying/) - Not exactly PG-13, but I loved it.
2.  [Dave Barry's Money Secrets](/2008/08/funny-finance-book/) - Anyone that has watched the clowns on CNBC will be ROFL.
3.  [American Shaolin](/2008/01/to-be-a-badass-kung-fu-master/ ) - Great stories of an American that travels to China wanting to be a Kung Fu master.

**Psychology**

1.  [The Definitive Book of Body Language](/2008/06/the-definitive-book-of-body-language/) - Most people are unaware of body language. This book has some excellent photos and drawings that demonstrate the _hidden language_.
2.  [Satisfaction](/2008/11/satisfaction-the-science-of-true-fulfillment/) - Novelty + Action = Satisfaction.
3.  [Predictably Irrational](/2008/04/why-are-we-predictably-irrational/) - A very good book explaining the different ways humans behave irrationally.

Worst book of the year? There were at least 20 books this year I started and bailed on. Just like movies, I no longer feel like I need to finish everything I start.
