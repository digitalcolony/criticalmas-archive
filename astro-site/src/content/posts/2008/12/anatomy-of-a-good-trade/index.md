A few days ago I posted [Anatomy of a Bad Trade](/2008/12/anatomy-of-a-bad-trade/), where I openly discussed the worst stock trade I ever did and the lessons I learned. This week I had a picture perfect trade, where I followed my rules and exited a position with a huge gain. My rules:

1.  Look for beaten down UltraShort ETFs with price support that are _on sale_ early in the week.
2.  Set stop loss in the event the price support fails.
3.  Lock in gain, preferably before the close on Friday.

Bought 90 SRS @78.22 on MON 12/8 Sold 90 SRS @99.78 on FRI 12/12 ![](./img/srs.png "srs") This time I didn't get greedy on a Friday. Instead I exited the trade and locked in the gain. Good thing I did, because the stock tanked shortly afterward almost 20%. Now it is the weekend and I'm holding no leveraged ETFs in my account and I'm another $1,920 closer to retirement. This was a good week. This is not investment advice, but I would not be surprised to see SRS do a similar moonshot move in the next week or two. Hit it and Quit It. Rinse and Repeat.

Does that take you closer to retirement or the next mini-retirement? :)

Real retirement.  That trade took place in my managed 401k account, so that money can't be accessed for some time.  

My next trade will likely be in my mini-retirement account.  :)
