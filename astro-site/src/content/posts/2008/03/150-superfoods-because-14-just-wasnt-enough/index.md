Last October, I devoured the book [SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life](/2007/10/are-these-the-14-superfoods/). It was the book I wish I had back in college when I first got interested in nutrition. That was before I discovered _The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth_. ![](./img/150-healthy-foods.jpg "150-healthy-foods") _The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth: The Surprising, Unbiased Truth About What You Should Eat and Why_ by Jonny Bowden is a reference book that should be in every kitchen. 150 foods are beautifully photographed and discussed. Even though I loved the SuperFoods RX book, I can see where it may be a dry read for others. Not this book. In addition to the author's opinions on food, the end of each chapter lists a Top 10 SuperFood list by many of the top nutritionists in the world. If you are looking for a book to spark an interest in food and nutrition with yourself or your family, this is the one.
