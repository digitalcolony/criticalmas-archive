Last year I read a book about [Kaizen](/2007/10/kaizen-the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari-and-the-dip/) and this book was recommended to me. ![Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LQhAdk2QL.jpg) _Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment by George Leonard_ details the steps and tools it takes to _master_ something. It was a quick read and I learned a few tips along the way. Here is a passage I liked from the part on setting priorities.

> Ultimately, liberation comes through the acceptance of limits. You can't do everything, but you can do one thing, and then another and another. In terms of energy, its better to make a wrong choice than none at all.

For a long time, I've been paralyzed on deciding how to improve [INeedCoffee.com](https://ineedcoffee.com). A week ago I decided to not fear making the wrong decision and to proceed with a bold redesign of the site -- one step at a time.
