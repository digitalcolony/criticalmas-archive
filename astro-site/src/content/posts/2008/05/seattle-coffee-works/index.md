Only in Seattle could a business this cool exist. There are so many quality roasters in Seattle it would be near impossible to run around town trying them all if one were on a short vacation. Alehouses can serve beer from several microbreweries at one location. Why not try it with coffee? Seattle Coffee Works has.

Seattle Coffee Works has many coffees from local roasters at their Pike Street location, which is just half a block away from the fish throwing fun at Pike Market Place. If you go to Seattle, you need to stop here. They also have a mail-order business and roast themselves.

Just when I thought I was almost finished trying every espresso blend in the area, I discover I've got many more blends to try. Good times.
