I finally got around to reading one of the most cited business books of the decade. In fairness, I read the original Wired article from October 2004 when it first came out.

![Long Tail, The, Revised and Updated Edition: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41h0cZRmWKL.jpg) Long Tail, The, Revised and Updated Edition: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More by Chris Anderson is the detailed examination of how we are moving from a _hit-based_ society to a _niche-based_ society. The thesis was more interesting four ago, today it seems so obvious. It is a good book, but most would be better off reading the Wired article first and then deciding if they wish to go deeper on the topic before picking up the book.

Read the article and it was very interesting.  The one bone I would pick is that there weren't more examples/case studies involving business outside of the entertainment industry (books, movies, music cd's are presented).   Does the book go beyond these?

A little.  It is mostly about examples of products that once occupied shelf space that now occupy virtual space.
