I've been with Blogger since April 2000 and I've finally had enough. It is clear that Google has no intention of repairing the code that runs the FTP accounts. It is slow and buggy. They have no intention of making their code XHTML compliant or conforming to MicroFormat standards. All they care about are the BlogSpot accounts. The beatings must end. It's time for this battered Blogger to move on. I've started the process of moving to WordPress. Moving to WordPress means my links will break. I'll do my best to make the transition smooth. It's a hit I'm now willing to take on CriticalMAS. DigitalColony which gets 8 times the traffic will be a far tougher move. ![destroyed-atm](./img/destroyed-atm.jpg) _This ATM machine works better than Blogger._
