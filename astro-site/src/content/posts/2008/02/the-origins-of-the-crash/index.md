One of my favorite genres of reading is financial history and nobody does a better job than Roger Lowenstein. ![Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NTVSK5MZL.jpg) _Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing by Roger Lowenstein_ is about the economic history leading up and covering the stock market crash of 2000-2002. This book is outstanding and I enjoyed it even more than his book [When Genius Failed](/2007/11/when-genius-failed/). It always a good exercise to step back from the day-to-day chaos of the markets and see the bigger picture. Knowing history is the first step to making sense of the present. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading Roger's new book when it gets released in May. That book is titled _While America Aged: How Pension Debts Ruined General Motors, Stopped the NYC Subways, Bankrupted San Diego, and Loom as the Next Financial Crisis._
