Despite having one of the least attractive book covers I've ever seen, _Just What I Said_ is an outstanding collection of economic columns from one of the best, Caroline Baum.

_Just What I Said: Bloomberg Economics Columnist Takes on Bonds, Banks, Budgets, and Bubbles by Caroline Baum_ is a nice collection of economic articles from the period of 1998 through 1994 that stands the test of time. If you find economic history, the Federal Reserve, debt markets, and interest rates interesting, give it a read. Otherwise, move along.
