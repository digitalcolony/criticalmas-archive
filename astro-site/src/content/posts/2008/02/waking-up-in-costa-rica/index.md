What is the best thing to read on a cold wet January day in Seattle? Maybe a book about how much cheaper and warmer life could be in Costa Rica. ![Moon Living Abroad in Costa Rica (Living Abroad)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2ByghYrI%2BL.jpg) Moon Living Abroad in Costa Rica (Living Abroad) is by Erin Van Rheenen and she sold me on Costa Rica. Although I seriously doubt I'll be buying any real estate on Planet Earth in the next two to five years, I did enjoy reading about life in Costa Rica. My favorite part was on page 52.

Warm weather and a decent bedtime. Sounds like heaven to me. During my 2006 visit to [South America](/2006/08/rio-to-buenos-aires-overview/), I found the opposite to be true. They woke up late and stayed up late. I'm an early riser. In [Montevideo, Uruguay](/2006/08/rio-to-buenos-aires-overview/), I walked around downtown looking for a breakfast place from 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM. Nobody was awake and nothing was open, except the so-American McDonalds. Although I could imagine living in Montevideo, I can't imagine sleeping until 9 AM. Prior to picking up this book, I looked at Moon Living Abroad in Nicaragua (Living Abroad) by Joshua Berman. No sale. Although cheaper than Costa Rica, the author painted this country as a little too poor for my liking. **Legacy Comments** Derek

> Costa Rica is near the top of my list of places I want to visit. Wonderful weather, beaches, coffee... Think Hawaii but without the very-high cost. Plus, my spanish is passable...
