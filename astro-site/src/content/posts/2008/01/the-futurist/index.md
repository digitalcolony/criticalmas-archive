Recently I read [The Black Swan](/2007/12/the-black-swan/) which exposed ideas of the fallacies of predictions. _The Futurist_ is a story about a man in that profession that comes to the same conclusion.

![The Futurist](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GJ2KZSY7L.jpg) The Futurist by James P. Othmer is a fictional book that follows a _futurist_ who has lost faith. He no longer believes in his work or even his profession. The Wired Blog wrote up a good review for this book at DR Book Club: The Futurist.
