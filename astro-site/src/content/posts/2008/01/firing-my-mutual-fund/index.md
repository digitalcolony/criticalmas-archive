Sometime in November, I got around to reading the Letter to the Shareholders for the Oakmark Equity and Income Fund. For about a year I had some money parked in this fund and I was up about $2,000. Not bad. But two lines in the Letter concerned me.

> We do not make economic forecasts but we do have to make investing decisions based on an understanding of the prevailing investing environment.

> While many economists have predicted a downturn in consumer spending, we believe evidence to date does not support this idea.

They don't make _economic forecasts_ and they don't see the evidence to support a downturn in consumer spending. Really? I decided to get my money out of that fund ASAP. In the first week of December, I put that money in the Prudent Bear Fund. They believe there will be a downturn in consumer spending and I'm pretty sure they take the time to make economic forecasts. What has happened since? [![](./img/mutual-fund.jpg "mutual-fund")](./img/mutual-fund.jpg) How do I feel right now? ![syriana-boom](./img/syriana-boom.jpg "syriana-boom")
