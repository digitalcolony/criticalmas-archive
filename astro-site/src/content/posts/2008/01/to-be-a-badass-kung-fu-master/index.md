When I was in middle school back in Columbus, there was a Saturday night TV show called _Black Belt Theater_. Every week they would run some low-budget martial arts movie. A common plot theme is for the young student to train in a martial arts school under the supervision of wise monks. A friend of mine was obsessed with these movies and was convinced that one day he would become a kung fu master. But he never pursued it.

![American Shaolin: Flying Kicks, Buddhist Monks, and the Legend of Iron Crotch: An Odyssey in theNew China](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H8Xdm8tCL.jpg) _American Shaolin: Flying Kicks, Buddhist Monks, and The Legend of Iron Crotch: An Odyssey in theNew China by Matthew Polly_ is the tale of an American who decides not only to take martial arts lessons but to travel to China and study kung fu with monks in a martial arts school. Just like in the movies.

I loved this book. Not only are the martial arts tales often humorous (The Legend of Iron Crotch), but it provides a great background into the culture of China. If I ever go to China, I will probably read this book again. Highly recommended.
