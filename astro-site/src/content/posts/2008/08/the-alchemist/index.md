The Alchemist is by Paulo Coelho is a book about following your dreams. Instead of having me fumble through a poorly written review, check out this [concise review](http://web.archive.org/web/20130125050201/http://blogcritics.org:80/books/article/book-review-the-alchemist-by-paulo) by Betty Wong.

Hello!

I'm a big fan of Paulo Coelho! You will love this! He's the first best-selling 
author to be distributing for free his works on his blog:

Have a nice day!
