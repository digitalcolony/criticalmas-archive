OK, it isn't a true finance book, but it is one hysterical read. ![Dave Barry's Money Secrets: Like: Why Is There a Giant Eyeball on the Dollar?](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51y%2BLB9tD5L._SL500_.jpg) _Dave Barry's Money Secrets: Like Why Is There a Giant Eyeball on the Dollar?_ by Dave Barry makes fun of the everyman economic advice handed out by the likes of Suze Orman. You will laugh until you cry. This is an outstanding book which was a great break from the serious financial books I normally read.
