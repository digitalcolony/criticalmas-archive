My apartment is technically in the basement, but the side facing the street is almost the first floor. The windows start at about the 4 foot level, so I have a decent view to look out. Seems the people passing by also can see in at me. When I'm doing dishes or cooking, I will occasionally make eye contact with a person walking past my street. They are mostly women walking dogs. I don't think they are paying attention to me. They probably see movement to their right and then look over at the building and see me. Well, I didn't think they really noticed me until the other day. I was walking through Queen Anne and a lady was approaching from the other direction talking to her friend. She saw me, stopped talking to her friend, looked directly at me and said hello like we were old friends. About a block down the road it hit me that the ONLY place I've seen this lady was walking past my window. If I were a young lady and she were an old man, I suppose I'd be creeped out, but it doesn't bother me. Does she like me or my stir fry?

Your stir fry, of course!  or perhaps she likes you BECAUSE of your stir fry. Nothing sexier than a man who cooks.....

You should have invited her up (down) for a Latte art demo.
