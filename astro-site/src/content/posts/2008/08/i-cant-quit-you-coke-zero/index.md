Really I tried. About two years ago I discovered Coke Zero. A zero-calorie version of Coke that didn't taste like a diet drink. It was amazing. After going years without drinking any soft drinks, I was back to a can a day. It was zero calories and I no longer feared Nutrasweet, what could go wrong?

Those on the sweetener, however, showed a diminished increase in temperature, suggesting that their physiology was in some way affected.

The article goes into how repeatedly fooling the brain with low/no calorie sweeteners may interfere with the body's ability to judge calories and the result is you end up eating more. Yikes.

Then after several days or a week, I'd rationalize just getting one drink. A 20-ounce bottle of Coke Zero from the quickie-mart is $1.62 after tax.

So like a cigarette smoker that figures out quitting isn't on the horizon, I decided to buy my carton equivalent. Today I caved in and bought a 24 pack. OK, I bought two, they were on sale. It's summer. Once we head into fall, I'll quit for real. Except for ...
