Some of you may be wondering why I've developed a sudden interest in cooking. I know quite a few single people in Seattle and they tend to find cooking to be a tedious chore.

> Why bother going through all that effort to cook for oneself? It is too much work for just one person.

I'm approaching food from a different angle. After deciding that [spending another thousand hours](/2008/06/buying-individual-stocks-doesnt-math-out-for-me/) studying finance wouldn't benefit me, I went back to my love for nutrition. Books like [SuperFoods RX](/2007/10/are-these-the-14-superfoods/), [The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth](/2008/03/150-superfoods-because-14-just-wasnt-enough/), [Mindless Eating](/2008/05/mindless-eating/), and more recently [Omnivore's Dilemma](/2008/07/the-omnivores-dilemma/) and [In Defense of Food](/2008/07/in-defense-of-food/) have challenged me to improve upon what most people would already consider a healthy diet. Now combine that with food inflation and the mentorship of a good friend who is fearless in the kitchen and you have the conditions for me to pursue cooking. I'm still a long way from being a great cook, but I'm certain that after a few hundred hours of practice I'll be as confident in the kitchen as I am when discussing actions by the Federal Reserve. :) ![150-healthy-foods](./img/150-healthy-foods.jpg) Taking more control over my food has also resulted in a nice side benefit. My body fat is dropping. By controlling the ingredients, I've been able to further reduce my intake of corn and processed soy. More on that in another post.

my mom always told me anyone who can read can cook...  you should be a great cook in no time!

One tip I can offer is that sometimes less is more...  especially in salads and soups.  

In fact, I think its time to make some pozole!

Thanks.  I just looked up pozole on the Wikipedia.  Looks like something to attempt.  Of course I'll use an Omega-3 meat and not pork.  :)
