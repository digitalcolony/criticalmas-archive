Way back on October 15th, 2003, I created a mix of the best Marilyn Manson songs to lift weights to.

> It's a 64 minute screaming adrenaline rush guaranteed to increase your workout intensity. I've pulled tracks from 5 different CDs (not the live one). My neighbors are going to love me.

Using the MixWit site I was able to recreate the mix. This time I trimmed the mix down from 15 tracks to 11 tracks. I must warn you that not all the lyrics are safe for work. Also, exposure to this mix close to weight equipment could result in significant muscle and strength gains. Did for me. I give you _MAScene 2.0_.

1.  Sweet Dreams - _Everybody's looking for something_
2.  The Dope Show - _Narcissistic and so shallow_
3.  (s)AINT - _You wanted perfect. You got your perfect._
4.  The Fight Song - _Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!_
5.  The Beautiful People - _Hey you, what do you see? Something beautiful, something free?_
6.  Great Big White World - _We used to love ourselves_
7.  Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth - _I'm on a campaign for pain_
8.  The Nobodies - _Today I am dirty. I want to be pretty._
9.  Disposable Teens - _The more that you fear us The bigger we get_
10.  This Is The New Shit - _Do we get it? No. Do we want it? Yeah._
11.  Coma White - _You were from a perfect world. A world that threw me away today._

The best weight-lifting line from a Marilyn Manson song is from _Use Your Fist And Not Your Mouth_.

> I woke up today and wished for tomorrow I don't want to be like anyone else I woke up today and wished for tomorrow I don't want to even be myself

UPDATE DEC 2008 - Mixwit shut down

Nice mix.  Too bad it's not downloadable from the site.

But I have all of those tunes anyway.  :-)
