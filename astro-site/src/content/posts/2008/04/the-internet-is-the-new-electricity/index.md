Last December Wired interviewed Nicholas Carr and labeled him _high-tech's Capitan Buzzkill_. Instead of being the typical cheerleader that everything new is better, Carr raised some concerns and wrote a book. ![The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GI4WzzjXL.jpg) _The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google by Nicholas Carr_ has two parts. Part one mixes the history of the spread of electricity and the very recent history of how the Internet is becoming more like a utility. Part two covers many topics that those knee-deep in web technologies are already familiar with mixed with some ethical and thought-provoking questions which he leaves for us to ponder. I loved part one. Part two was still good, but I had already been exposed to much of that content before in other books and articles. Recommended.
