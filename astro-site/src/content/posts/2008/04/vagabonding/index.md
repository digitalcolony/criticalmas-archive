The [4-Hour Workweek](/2007/12/defending-the-4-hour-workweek/) exposed me to the idea of working on the road. Although I'm pretty good at working remotely, more instruction was needed on the traveling part.

![Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417J0YTSGVL._SL500_.jpg) Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel by Rolf Potts is a collection of essays and tips written for those considering living on the road. The book spends a good chunk of time explaining the difference between being a tourist and being a traveler.

If you are considering packing a backpack and heading out for a few months (or years) be sure to read this book. The author also has a well-researched list of resources that are available on the Vagabonding website.
