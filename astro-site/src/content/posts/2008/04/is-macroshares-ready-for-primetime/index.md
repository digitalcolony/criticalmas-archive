The company MacroShares offers two ETFs where you can bet on the direction of the price of oil. Back in January I posted [My Drudge Report Oil Short Investment Tip](/2008/01/my-drudge-report-oil-short-investment-tip/). Using that information I was able to use the MacroShares DCR ticker to make a few thousand dollars on quick trades. Yesterday I received tax information in the mail from MacroShares. Yesterday was April 3rd. My taxes were finished and sent in weeks ago. What kind of a financial outfit waits until April before sending out customer tax forms? Not one I'll be using anytime soon. UPDATE: [MacroShares Terminated](http://web.archive.org/web/20130313194552/http://www.indexuniverse.com:80/sections/news/7058-macroshares-terminated.html). Called that one.
