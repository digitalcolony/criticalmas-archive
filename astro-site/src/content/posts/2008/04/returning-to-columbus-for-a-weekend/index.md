I got tired of waiting for my high school reunion planning committee to set a date for my 20th (now 21st) high school reunion. Guess I'll catch them at the 25th. I'm heading back for a long weekend from Thursday April 17th through Tuesday April 22nd. Family, friends, Ted's Montana Grill, Donatos Pizza, Staufs, etc. You know the drill. ![Ted](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/353059684_e7b7c16361.jpg) _Photo by Flickr user [elmada](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/353059684_e7b7c16361.jpg)._
