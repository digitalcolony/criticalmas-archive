I've dug around and assembled a photo gallery for my first home located on Holly Oak Lane in Escondido, California. Although I'm glad to have sold the house at the top of the San Diego market, I do miss that house. Maybe someday I'll buy it back. The new owners put in upgraded floors and counters. They also added a swimming pool to the back yard. ![holly-oak-1](./img/holly-oak-1.jpg) ![3377-Holly_oak](./img/3377-Holly_oak.jpg) [Photo Gallery for Home on Holly Oak Lane](https://www.flickr.com/photos/129592470@N02/sets/72157650114052022/)
