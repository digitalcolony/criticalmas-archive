I've been going overboard on the finance books in the last few months, so I decided to get far away from Wall Street for my next few book selections. How far away from Wall Street? How does Africa sound? ![Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413lD0gO7qL._SL500_.jpg) Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide by Peter Allison is a collection of stories by a safari tour operator. This quick read is an enjoyable introduction to life on the safari. Before you head out on your African adventure, give this book a read. ![The Adventurist: My Life in Dangerous Places](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51An%2BdODV-L.jpg) The Adventurist: My Life in Dangerous Places by Robert Young Pelton was a letdown. It was a good mini-biography of Robert Young Pelton, but it lacked the brilliant witty writing found in his massive travel guidebook [The World's Most Dangerous Places](/2007/11/the-most-dangerous-places-in-the-world/). I really hope he releases a new version of that 2002 guidebook. My hunch tells me Iraq is more dangerous now and Colombia is safer.

Bummer...I like the book...Have you read "Licensed to Kill" or the new article in Men's Journal?

I liked the book too, but I LOVED The Worlds Most Dangerous Places.  Referring to the murderous Chechnyians as "ornery" was genius.

I have not read Licensed to Kill or the new article.  I will though.
