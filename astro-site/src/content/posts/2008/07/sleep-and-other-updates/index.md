Good news. I'm now sleeping a full 7-8 hours each night. A few nights ago I slept in until 7 AM, which worked out to 9 hours and 15 minutes. It has been years since I have slept in that late. 7 AM may seem early to many, but to me, it is like NOON.

Being well rested has increased my productivity with the INeedCoffee project. So far over [1,200 photos](http://flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/sets/) from April 1999 through June 2005 have been tagged and uploaded to Flickr. Several of the articles will still need new photos. Remember that I grew up during the [Pixel Depression](/2008/06/growing-up-during-the-pixel-depression/).

This summer got off to a rocky start, but things are going well now. On the [About page](https://criticalmas.org/about/) you can now see that I appointed myself _The King of Queen Anne_. It's good to be King. ;)

Good for you, brother. I'm pulling for you and am glad to hear it. Good rest, good food, good exercise, good work, good relationships leads to a good life indeed. Sounds like you're getting on your way with most of them.
