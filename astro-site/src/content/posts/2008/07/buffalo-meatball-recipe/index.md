Call me [Omega 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) man. None of that corn-fed, hormone-filled beef for me. No thanks. I'll take the grass-fed buffalo any day. After averaging several recipes together and checking what I had in my kitchen, I developed this buffalo meatball recipe. Simple and delicious. ![](./img/meatballs.jpg) _Photo is titled Meatball Army from Flickr user Mr. Usaji. His photo of meatball preparation was much better than mine._

-   1 pound ground buffalo
-   4oz ricotta cheese
-   1 small onion diced
-   1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional)
-   salt
-   1 clove garlic diced or pressed

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix above ingredients in a bowl. Roll mix into walnut size meatballs. Lightly coat pan with oil. Place meatballs on the tray. Cook for 23 minutes. Done. If pressed for time, you can cook in a lightly oiled pan for about 10 minutes. I tried both ways and slightly preferred the taste of the oven cooked buffalo meatballs.

what would these be like without the ricotta? does it get too dry without that? (i'm not a big ricotta fan).

They should be fine without the ricotta.  I've also used mozzarella.

Mine had a weird texture and slightly ?gamey. do you think it was bcuz I put it right into the sauce (no baking). I got the meat from Whole Foods, made it the same day. ???

@Sienna - If you found the taste gamey, I would try the recipe using 50% buffalo and 50% ground beef.

Never mind. must've been in my head. They sat in the sauce overnight and my family devoured them the next day &amp; said they were amazing. I tried them again and they tasted great. Thanks M!
