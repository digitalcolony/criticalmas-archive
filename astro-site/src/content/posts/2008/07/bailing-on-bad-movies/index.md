Ever since I started watching movies as a kid, I would stick with the movie no matter how bad it got. There was something about not quitting. I needed to stick through the movie just to give myself permission to trash the film. A few months ago, I ended this policy.

Now, as soon as I do not enjoy a movie and lose hope that it will improve, I will stop watching the DVD. And because I haven't finished the movie, I don't believe it is fair for me to review it. However, there must be a way to distinguish between movies you review, movies you never saw, and movies you bailed on. What we need is a new review symbol. Perhaps just the letter "B". The "B" would indicate the reviewer bailed on the movie.

Here are the movies that I bailed on in the last two months.

-   **No Country For Old Men (2007) -** After 20 minutes of disgusting violence, I bailed. I know it is a great movie, but I found the first 20 minutes so disturbing that I rewatched Amelie just to cleanse my movie palate.
-   **In Bruges (2008)** - Another movie that was supposed to be good. I was bored out of my skull after 30 minutes.
-   **Cat Ballou (1965)** - This Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda Western was listed as a comedy. After 22 minutes without a single laugh, I paused the movie and went to IMDB to confirm it was supposed to be a comedy. Sure enough it was listed as a comedy.  I stopped the DVD.
-   **Happiness (1998)** \- The characters were uncomfortably creepy. Stopped the movie after 20 minutes.
-   **Dan In Real Life (2007)** - I didn't even make it through the opening credits. Teenage daughters yelling at their father. It was like a bad episode of _Gimme A Break_. After 8 minutes, I bailed on the movie and went into a quiet room to make the pain disappear.

I find my self fast forwarding with the DVD more often.  Last night I hit FF 5 times watching Statement.  Plot was very repetitive.

Here in Baku, there are a lot of cheap copies which some people bring to the office, I'd say 2/3 of the newer films really aren't worth watching.
