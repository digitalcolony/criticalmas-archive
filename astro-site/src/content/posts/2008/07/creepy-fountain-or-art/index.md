Just north of the Seattle Aquarium, there is a fountain sculpture of a nude man reaching out to a nude boy. Maybe I can't appreciate art, but to me, this looks like a prequel to an Amber Alert. ![creepy-fountain-3](./img/creepy-fountain-3.jpg) ![creepy-fountain-2](./img/creepy-fountain-2.jpg) ![creepy-fountain-1](./img/creepy-fountain-1.jpg) The uproar over this statue happened back in 2005.
