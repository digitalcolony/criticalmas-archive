The summer of stir fry continues. This week I did a Thai red shrimp curry, which turned out a notch better than last week's Peanut Tofu with Yo Choy. I named this recipe rainbow after I did all the prep work. When I looked down at the cutting board I had green, red, yellow and orange peppers all chopped. Basically a _rainbow_ of peppers.

-   garlic
-   onion
-   green pepper
-   yellow pepper
-   red pepper
-   orange pepper
-   red curry paste
-   coconut cream w/water (cheaper than coconut milk)
-   shrimp
