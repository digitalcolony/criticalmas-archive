Over the past three years, I've read many financial books across various subtopics. Although I had intended to take a break from the finance books, I couldn't pass up a chance to read this book. ![More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places (Updated and Expanded) (Columbia Business School Publishing)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51B2Yk%2BHjAL.jpg) _More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places (Updated and Expanded) (Columbia Business School Publishing) by Michael J. Mauboussin_ for me was a tight well-written summary of many of the ideas I was exposed to in other financial and psychology books. The book is broken down into 30 essays in 4 parts. If you are looking for a good collection of unconventional financial topics (philosophy, psychology, statistics) easily explained, give this book a read. If you've already read [Taleb](/2008/03/fooled-by-randomness/), [Mauldin](/2007/03/too-many-choices-the-science-of-influence/), and [The Wisdom of Crowds](/2008/06/the-wisdom-of-crowds/), this book will do an outstanding job of tightening up your understanding.
