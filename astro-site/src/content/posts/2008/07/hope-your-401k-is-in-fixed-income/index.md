Three months I mentioned in the post [Mr. Financial Planner - Go Home and Get Your Shine Box!](/2008/04/mr-financial-planner-go-home-and-get-your-shine-box/) how 100% of my company-managed 401K was in the Fixed Income fund.

> The statement lists the returns for all the investment options I had at my disposal. My _Cash Fixed Fund_ earned just a 0.97% return. But that was enough to make it the best performing fund on the list. Every other fund lost money. All the stock funds lost between 8% and 17% during that same time period. All the bond funds lost money too. So did the packaged allocations, including the _Conservative_ option which lost over 3%.

My latest statement once again shows that almost all the funds lost money except the Fixed Income. In a bear market **preservation of capital not appreciation of capital** is your number one goal.
