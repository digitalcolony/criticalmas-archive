Two months ago I heard David Lynch being interviewed on the Ron and Fez Show (XM 202). In the interview, he was discussing a book he had just completed. I'm a big fan of the movie director, so I put it on my required reading list. ![Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WJ8G7M4ZL._SL500_.jpg) Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity by David Lynch covers a wide range of topics in a broken-down essay format. Each essay ranges from one sentence to two pages. Lynch shares his thoughts on creativity and his love for [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation). Along the way, he tells how he got the ideas for some of his classic film moments. The character Killer Bob from Twin Peaks started as a guy working on the set moving furniture. Fans of David Lynch and filmmaking will enjoy this quick read.
