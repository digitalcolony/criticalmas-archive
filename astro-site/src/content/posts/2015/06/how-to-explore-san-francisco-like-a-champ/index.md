I will be leaving the San Francisco Bay Area in one month and returning to Seattle. During the year I was here, I explored the hell out of the area. I saw more of San Francisco than many will see in years or decades. Two or three times a week I ventured into San Francisco early and then spend hours urban hiking. I estimate that I've urban hiked over 300 miles in the city.


### Leverage Your Hobby To Explore Different Neighborhoods


My hobby is espresso. I love visiting the best coffee shops a city has to offer. When I first got here, I made a [cafe spreadsheet](http://tinyurl.com/sf-espresso) with all the places I wanted to visit. Each was a gateway into a new neighborhood. I'd find the coffee shop first, get a tasty beverage, and then walk around the area. Many times I would find two or three coffee shops, sometimes miles apart, and then build a hike around those stops.

_Here is a hike I did in February that ended up being [15.7 miles.](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6527608) Along the way, I visited four coffee shops and as you can from the map, several neighborhoods. If you are looking for my favorites, see [My Guide to San Francisco Espresso (2015)](/2015/01/guide-san-francisco-espresso-2015/)._ 

After I completed my coffee shop list, I found a new hobby: Instagram. Years ago when I first moved to Seattle, I brought my camera with me on my hikes. It made exploration more enjoyable. But over the years, I stopped bringing my camera and lost interest in taking pictures. With Instagram, I got the photo bug again. Now I can take a picture, add a location, and share it immediately.

Your hobby is likely something else. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as you can apply it to the city as a way to explore.


### Get in Shape


San Francisco is a hilly city. If you are not in shape, you will get winded quickly. Fortunately for me, I never get winded, because I understand that aerobic conditioning comes from strength and not from doing "cardio". By making your leg muscles two, three, or ten times stronger, you will find movement much easier. I can charge up an SF hill while holding a conversation without pause. I do ZERO cardio. I lift and I walk. I haven't broken a sweat exercising in a decade.

I was able to hack my leg strength by using the principles of HIT (High-Intensity Training). This is not to be confused with the more popular HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training). HIT uses very slow controlled movements along with static holds to target fast-twitch muscle fibers. And just takes minutes to do.

If you are planning a visit to SF and want to get into shape, I highly recommend the workouts in the books Body By Science (machines) and [Hillfit](/2013/07/hillfit-2-0-a-zero-budget-approach-to-high-intensity-training/) (bodyweight). You can also watch the 10-minute long [Dr. Doug McGuff Workout video](https://youtu.be/FVhhbC51_3k). Jump to 7:30 to see the slow leg press. Do that 1-2 times a week and you'll never get winded hiking.


### Toughen Up Your Cold Tolerance


I did a post a few months after I arrived titled [The Temperature Wimps of San Francisco](/2014/09/temperature-wimps-san-francisco/). Hiking SF will be more pleasurable if you don't have to carry around a coat or scarf. I have been here now for 11 months and I have not worn a jacket a single day. The coldest it has gotten has been 52 F (11 C).

People here assume because I am from Seattle that I am better able to handle cold temperatures. Nope. People from Seattle are pretty soft too when it comes to temperature. Not as soft as SF, but still soft. I am resilient to colder temperatures by choice. I decided I was tired of being miserable when the temperature dropped, so I trained my body to throw off mounds of heat. I cover this topic in general on the post [You Broke Your Own Metabolism](/2011/06/you-broke-your-own-metabolism/) and in detail on my [Cold Weather Exposure](/tag/cold/) page.

The north part of SF and some streets in downtown can be windy, but most of the city is fine. Don't believe that nonsense that SF is a cold city. The people in Minnesota are laughing at the ridiculousness of that statement.

### Get a Streetwise Map


I know everyone has a smartphone with a GPS. I do as well. But I learned San Francisco with a laminated map. The map tells me the different neighborhoods and lets me gauge at a glance much more area than a phone screen. I also purchased a compass keychain on eBay for 50 cents. On a cloudy day, knowing which way is North is helpful.

### Explore the History of San Francisco...For Free!


The San Francisco Library sponsors something called [San Francisco Walking Tours](http://www.sfcityguides.org/). Every day there are multiple free tours (donations accepted) exploring different parts of San Francisco. I've been on about 25 of the tours and plan to do a few more this month. I've learned so much about SF on these tours that have taken me all over the city.

I highly recommend doing these tours. Try and arrive ten minutes early. They do not wait for stragglers.


### Wrap Up


If you get a chance to visit San Francisco, I hope this guide helps you. It is a wonderful city to explore.

Great article! I totally agree about having a laminated map.

I spent 10 days at the Fairmont. Took the drive to Carmel and San Simeon.

Some say that 'slow burn' is tantamount to an isometric contraction.  Michael Eades co-authored a book with Fred Hahn.  

Here are my notes.  Hopefully you can access the Google Drive link.

@Brian - I had one for Seattle and Kuala Lumpur too. Love the Streetwise series. 

@Gary - Reading your notes now. Thank you!

You don't do any cardio except for all the walking, which by the sounds of it, is purely aerobic work for you. So I would say you do a lot of cardio :-)

@Nick - Which is why I stated that I do not get winded or break a sweat. Both of which I feel are conditions common to being in the aerobic zone. When I am am walking, my pace is relaxed and my heart rate lower than what is considered cardio work.

I just realized you listed coffee shops in the south bay.  I will have to go check those out with my parents!  I'm always telling them how the coffee in San Francisco is better (and sometimes less expensive for better product).

@All - I am completing my one year in the SF Bay Area in just a few days. Here are my final TOP 5 rankings in order:

#1 Chromatic Coffee
#2 Ritual Coffee 
#3 Stanza Coffee (Haight not Mission)
#4 Devout Coffee
#5 Front Cafe

Awesome.  Will definitely have to try Chromatic, since that's practically from my hometown.  Wish I had caught on earlier that you were in SF for a year.  I'm sure my trainer (David DeSisto) would have loved to meet you and geek out on HIT.
