Yesterday I sent out my 3rd newsletter, which I called Eliminate. For those that aren't signed up, here is a direct link to Newsletter #3:

After I sent the newsletter, I noticed an extra word in the first sentence. Unlike a webpage, there is no way for me to go back in time and eliminate that word. Doesn't appear to be a way to fix the archived copy either. That error will live on. Probably a lesson there. If you have any others comments regarding the newsletter, leave them below. ![snow-smile](./img/snow-smile.jpg)

Also, under Disposable Content, you wrote:

<blockquote>I made it clear that I do like like to write opinion pieces. </blockquote>

Now, was that merely a repetition, or did you mean to write "not like" instead of "like like"?

@garymar - Yes. Another error. Uggh. You'd think I had been sick for over a month and got rusty on my writing and editing skills. :)

MAS, I don't know what word processor you use, but my MS Word has a doubled word flag you can set to catch precisely these errors.

@garymar – For that I just used the MailChimp editor window. Lesson learned.
