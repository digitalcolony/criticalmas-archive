One of the projects I work on is the audio archive site for the late Miami radio host [Neil Rogers](https://neilrogers.org/), which I discussed in the post [My Tribute to Radio's Neil Rogers](/2014/01/tribute-radios-neil-rogers/).

Like other radio shows, one of the things Neil did during the show was play sound drops. Last year I created a free soundboard on the site Soundboard.com using some of the recovered drops. The site was fine, but it was a pain in ass to sort tracks. You had to drag each track by hand inside a small window. Not a problem if you have 10 tracks, but as the soundboard grew to over 150 drops, it became cumbersome. It could take 10 minutes to upload a single drop and drag it into alphabetical order.

Frustrated, I reached out to Soundboard.com and offered my suggestion to provide an option or setting that would sort tracks alphabetically. They ignored my request. I waited a month or two and reached out again repeating my request. They ignored me again. Why post your email address if you don't want your users to contact you? Plus I consider my feedback valuable that would make their product better for all users. But I was ignored.

We live in great times. There is so much free information on the Internet to help us accomplish tasks. **In the past being unsatisfied with a product or service was not a call to action. Today it is.**

I finally had enough with Soundboard.com, so I decided to code my own. In one weekend, I taught myself just enough PHP, HTML5 and JQuery to not only create a worthy replacement, but a soundboard that is superior to theirs. _I did get some help from my pal [Joe Crawford](https://artlung.com/) on the JQuery. Thanks Joe!_

My Simple Soundboard beats Soundboard.com in 4 ways.

1.  Loads way faster. Their page takes 5 seconds to load. Mine under 1 second.
2.  Tablet and Mobile friendly. Their soundboard isn't.
3.  Sorts alphabetically automatically. No more dragging individual track into order!
4.  You can play multiple drops simultaneously. Not theirs.

I am making the [code available on Github](https://github.com/digitalcolony/Simple-Soundboard) for anyone to use for free, no attribution necessary.

In the end I learned some cool coding techniques. Thank you for the frustration Soundboard.com. You are free to use my code as well.

Haha, that's awesome! I love when people take matters into their own hands. Soundboard.com really missed out by ignoring your feedback. Open-sourcing it is super cool, too! Great job!
