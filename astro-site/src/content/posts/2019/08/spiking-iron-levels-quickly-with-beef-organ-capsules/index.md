Two weeks ago, [I mentioned](/2019/07/an-ethical-case-for-not-being-100-vegan/) how eating less meat had reduced my iron levels to 36.0, which is the lowest I've ever had. In order to donate blood in Washington, a man needs a hematocrit level of 39.0. In the past, I've missed that number by a hair. On a few occasions, I scored a 38.8 or a 38.9. Then after two weeks of eating pumpkin seeds and other mostly plant-based foods, I return to donate blood and score a 39.0.

I wanted to see just how powerful beef organs could be in quickly raising my iron levels. I supplemented daily with 3 capsules of Grassfed Beef Organs for two weeks and then went to donate yesterday. My levels jumped all the way to 39.0.

So in summary:

-   🌳 2 weeks of plant-based food increased my iron levels by 0.2.
-   🐮 2 weeks of beef organ capsules increased my iron levels by **3.0**!

Animal-based iron for the win. A 15x increase in 2 weeks!

I like a lot of things the [smart vegans](/2019/06/listening-to-the-smartest-vegans/) are saying, but when it comes to iron, plant-based sources are weak compared to beef organs. Now, I have no doubt that I'll be able to donate again in a few months and get my 5-gallon pin before the year ends.

And by the way, 3 capsules is considered just half a daily dose.
