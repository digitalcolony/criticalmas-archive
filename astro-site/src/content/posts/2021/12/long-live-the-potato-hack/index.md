Unlike most bloggers, I run a [broken link checker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/) to alert me if any of my links break. Then I can repair the link, so if you as a reader click on a link here, you won't get an error.

A week ago, I started getting reports that Tim Steele's potatohack.com was down. I reached out to him to see what was going on. He informed me that he was no longer going to pay WordPress.com to map the domain to his blog ([potatohack.wordpress.com](https://potatohack.wordpress.com/)). I offered to take the domain and set up a potato hack portal. He accepted. 😁

Yesterday, I got the new domain up and running with a new HTTPS certificate on one of my hosts. Right now, [PotatoHack.com](https://potatohack.com/) is a simple list of links. Getting the page online quickly so inbound links resolved was the most important step.

I'm glad this domain was saved from the [Digital Graveyard](/2017/03/digital-graveyard-health-fitness-mentors/).

Now it is time to make the page pretty. This week I will start building out a nicer potato portal. I want to link to Tim's book, blog, and some of my potato posts. What else would you like to see on the PotatoHack page?
