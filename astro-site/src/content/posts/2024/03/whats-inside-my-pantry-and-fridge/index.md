I posted [What I Eat and What I Don't Eat - 2023 Edition](/2023/09/what-i-eat-and-what-i-dont-eat-2023-edition/) six months ago. I plan to add a new edition later this year or next. In the meantime, I thought I'd do a show-and-tell with my pantry. These are the foods that keep me lean. They also happen to be inexpensive compared to the foods that are making so many people overweight.

I primarily cook with an Instant Pot. I also use an Air Fryer and a rice cooker.

### Notes


The dehydrated veggies are non-perishable food in case of emergency or if I need a pinch of veggies for soup and I don't feel like chopping up something fresh.

I stopped buying meat and most dairy. I'm experimenting with a more plant-based diet. I'm only a few months into my "almost" pesco-vegan diet experiment. I'll let you know how it goes later this year or early next year.

Interestingly, a YouTube channel I follow called Conquer Aging Or Die Trying! did a video recently showing the diet he has used to [reduce his biological age by 19.5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUEGbBEPzgo). Our diets have a lot of overlap. He appears to be a pesco-vegan. When I ran my 2022 numbers through the formula, my biological age was 17 years younger. Peasant diet for the win!

What is your living situation?  Family, partner, etc?

There are so many food items in your cabinet that would give me endless headaches. You must have a strong constitution.

@Aaron - I am fully stocked now, which is why I took the photo. 

Most of my meals are mixing a grain with a legume. Add veggies and hot sauce.

This is helpful! also find my diet moving in this direction. Less to no meat and more legumes and fish. Satiating, cheap and healthy. I am still having dairy (low fat yoghurt) with my oats. Mainly to get quite a bit of protein without a lot of calories. Curious to know how you approach dairy in your diet.

@Joep - The only dairy I am buying is fat-free Greek yogurt. Although I rarely eat out, I won't stress if there is dairy in a dish.

Hi MAS, re: Conquer Aging Or Die Trying!, I notice he regularly eats sardines (100g per day). Do you know if he has ever addressed the heavy metal issue that I'm sure you blogged about in the past?  You used Chorella I think for chelation?

@S C MELVILLE - I noticed that as well. I'm newish to his channel, so I don't know the answer. Yes, I supplement with Chlorella, Spirulina, and eat a fair amount of cilantro. 

I love what Conquer Aging is doing. I expect to learn a lot from him.

@MAS Wow, you stock a lot of food.  When I lived alone, I had a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, and a container of Folgers.  :-)

@Jim - Ha! I didn't show you my coffee section. I have a photo gallery for that.

This is a really helpful post. Good to see the practical/ physical outcome of your diet.

oh my gosh, I would starve. Not that I dislike a lot of this food, it's just high carb. I've started a new nutrition program @AutumnBates on youtube, I've had a lot of success. Her website is called Autumn Elle Nutrition; it's using science to become metabolically healthy. Her nutrition plan of eating protein, fat, and fiber helps treat my insulin resistance (aka, sugar sensitivity). I buy all of my proteins at 30% - 50% off (aka, I just buy what's on sale at the store) and then freeze it. It's not that expensive compared to what I was spending before. Lots of delicious meals, which is important. 

I've lost about 14.5 - 16 pounds since April. 

I've taken a bit of a "deep dive" into Big Food, currently reading "Salt, Sugar, Fat: how the food giants hooked us" by Michael Moss. I gave away all of my seed oil foods, and added sugar foods.

@Julia - Great to hear from you. Congrats on your weight loss. 

I'm never hungry, because my carbs are unprocessed with fiber. I also make sure to get a decent amount of protein. 

Salt, Sugar, Fat is a good book. You probably would like the Dorito Effect as well.

oh my gosh, thanks for the book recommendation! The public library near me has 4 copies, so I will def read this book (although I have like 7 books checked out already), plus he wrote another one I'm interesting in, "The End of Craving." All good stuff!! 

Oh, btw, I'm down 17 pounds now! Whoohoo! 

But I read on Zoe Harcombe's website (British obesity researcher) that only 2% of people maintain a weight loss of 20 pounds. Wow. You're in the 2% with your 40 pound weight loss! 

Zoe Harcombe is a complete meat-eater though. I enjoy reading her blog.

@Julia - I really liked The End of Craving as well. I plan to post on it, but I need to post a few things first.

Congrats on the 17.
