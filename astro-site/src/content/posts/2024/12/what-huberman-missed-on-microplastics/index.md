Recently, The Huberman Lab did a show devoted to microplastics. The show was good, and I learned some things, but I think he missed some details.

[The Effects of Microplastics on Your Health & How to Reduce Them](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-microplastics-on-your-health-how-to-reduce-them)

I'll start this post with some show notes, followed by my thoughts.


### Overview


The podcast episode covered a wide range of potential health problems associated with microplastics and nanoplastics, emphasizing that research in this area is still developing, and much remains unclear about the long-term consequences for human health.

It is important to note that the sources primarily discuss correlative data, meaning that the presence of microplastics is observed alongside certain health conditions, but a direct cause-and-effect relationship hasn't been definitively established in humans.

**Endocrine Disruption:** Microplastics and nanoplastics often contain or carry endocrine-disrupting chemicals like BPA, BPS, and phthalates. These chemicals can mimic or block hormones like estrogen and testosterone, potentially interfering with hormone-sensitive processes throughout the body.

**Reproductive Health:** Studies have linked phthalate exposure to decreased testosterone levels in men, women, and children. The strongest associations were observed in women and men aged 40-60. This age range coincides with perimenopause and menopause in women, a period already marked by hormonal shifts and potential vulnerability to endocrine disruptors. Additionally, microplastics have been detected in human testes and semen, correlating with lower sperm counts and motility.

**Hormone-Dependent Cancers:** Endocrine disruption raises concerns about potential increases in hormone-dependent cancers, particularly in tissues with high cell turnover rates like the ovaries, testes, and breasts.

**Gastrointestinal Issues:** A study found higher microplastic levels in stool samples from people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared to those without IBS.

**Cardiovascular Disease:** Polyethylene, a common plastic component, has been found in arterial plaques from patients with cardiovascular disease. While their role in plaque formation needs further investigation, these microplastic particles could contribute to the blockage of blood flow in arteries.

**Liver Damage:** Microplastics can accumulate in the liver, potentially impacting its detoxification processes. Additionally, "forever chemicals" like PFAS, often associated with microplastics, are known to cause liver damage.

**Immune System Dysfunction:** Exposure to microplastics and associated chemicals, like PFAS, could potentially disrupt the immune system's function, making the body more susceptible to infections and diseases.

**Neurodevelopmental Concerns:** While a direct link hasn't been established, the presence of microplastics in the placenta and babies' first stool raises concerns about potential impacts on brain development.


### Advice


Avoid drinking water from plastic bottles, especially those exposed to heat. Also, the linings of paper cups designed to hold hot liquids, such as coffee or tea, typically contain BPA and BPS, even if the cup itself doesn't have a plastic lid,

Limit consumption of canned soup and other foods packaged in plastic.

Choose alternatives to single-use plastics whenever possible.

Incorporate cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower into your diet, as they contain sulforaphane, a compound that can enhance liver detoxification.

Consume sufficient dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to help bind and excrete toxins.

Opt for pink Himalayan salt or other non-marine salts instead of sea salt, which can contain microplastics.

Engage in activities that promote sweating, such as sauna use, hot baths, or exercise, to potentially aid in toxin removal.

Reduce clothing purchases and reuse clothes to minimize microfiber shedding.

Use cast iron or ceramic cookware instead of non-stick options.

Choose glass or steel containers over plastic for food storage and microwaving.


### What Huberman Missed


Huberman never once mentioned donating blood or plasma. There have been a number of stories on how donating blood and especially plasma have on purging the body of these toxins.

[Regular Blood Donations Can Reduce Toxic Forever Chemicals in the Bloodstream: Study](https://theswaddle.com/regular-blood-donations-can-reduce-toxic-forever-chemicals-in-the-bloodstream-study/)

I've donated around 6 gallons of blood since 2010. My guess is I've purged quite a bit of these potentially dangerous particles.

This next part is speculation, but I believe it is probably true.

Huberman mentioned how these particles can end up in the brain, testes, liver, lungs, and placenta. But they also can be stored in fat tissue. Not just our fat tissues, but the fat tissues of the animals we consume.

From Gemini:

> Animals, especially those higher up the food chain, can accumulate PFAS through their diet. This is known as bioaccumulation. As animals consume plants or other animals that have absorbed PFAS, the concentration of these chemicals can increase in their tissues.

How much of these microplastics and PFAS are in animal fat? How does it compare with plastic water bottles and other known sources? We don't know. It may be alarmist or I might be spot on. Someone will need to do the research.

In the meantime, I'll continue to donate blood, follow the tips Huberman outlined, and minimize my intake of animal fat.

_No thanks. Pass the lentils._

Cows aren't particularly high up the food chain, they eat grass. I guess don't eat tuna.
