Tim Ferriss recently had an excellent show related to injuries and recovery.

[_Dr. Keith Baar, UC Davis — Simple Exercises That Can Repair Tendons (Tennis Elbow, etc.), Collagen Fact vs. Fiction, Isometrics vs. Eccentrics, JAK Inhibitors, Growth Hormone vs. IGF-1, The Anti-RICE Protocol, and How to Use Load as an Anti-Inflammatory (#797)._](https://tim.blog/2025/02/26/dr-keith-baar/)

Although much of the podcast focused on practical methods for using isometric loads to enhance strength and speed up injury recovery, Dr. Baar shared an insightful observation about NFL players, highlighting their approach to strength training and risk management.

> I’ve done lots of NFL consulting, and I always go into the weight room and I always see the rookies and the second-year players are over in the squat racks doing all kinds of dynamic movements. All pro veterans, they’re all over in the machines because they know that those machines are going to keep them healthy. Those machines are going to get them that $30 million contract.
> 
> Yeah, you might get a half a step faster by being over there, but for the veteran, they know that if they’re available for 16 games of the year, they’re going to get their next contract because they’re going to perform at a high level.

Sorry bros. Even the NFL doesn't believe you MUST SQUAT to be strong and elite. Minimizing injury risk is the path to a longer career.

I remember when  Tim, after he  went on Rogan, was first toying with the idea of maybe doing a few podcast episodes.  Now it looks like his podcast will end up being his major public achievement.

It does also depend on the machine, the exercise, and how that machine is used. Some machines are designed better than others, some exercises are, biomechanically, safer than others and some people will still find a way to make a relatively safe exercise, more risky.

I thought you were done arguing with the “bros” over exercises like the barbell squat (I agree with you by the way). 
You do realise that you run the risk of reopening that can of worms don’t you?

@Stuart - I'm sure the NFL has the resources to get the best equipment for their players. 

I'm not arguing anything, just sharing information and citing a source.

MAS,
          I’ve no doubt that the NFL can afford all and any amount of equipment, but it’s whether they make the right choices with that money.
Anyone remember the Hammer Strength Jammer machine for “ground based” functional training that was all the rage in the NFL and universities a few years ago?
I saw that used (not well…”explosively” and in poor form) in videos.

The 1972 Miami Dolphins went undefeated. They were noted for their use of Nautilus machines.  This undefeated NFL team was also noted for few injuries.
