Cold exposure is a hot topic again.

Like most health topics, a predictable pattern has emerged. Some people experiment with an idea. They experience benefits. They share the benefits. Others join in and see benefits, and then they start exaggerating and overclaiming the benefits received. This is when the debunkers arrive. They pick off and destroy the weakest points of the movement, declaring victory over the entire topic.

I have a mixed view on the claims regarding cold exposure. Before I dive in, I'll share my background.

I first started exploring cold exposure in 2008. I had moved to Seattle from San Diego and was experiencing cold again for the first time in years, and I was not happy. I came across the writings of Art De Vany, an early Paleo thought leader, who discussed intentional cold exposure as a means of building resiliency.

I spent years experimenting and put together a [collection of posts on cold exposure](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/cold-weather-training/).

The three reasons I see cited the most in support of cold exposure are:

1.  Faster recovery post-workout.
2.  Fat loss
3.  Longevity


### Faster Recovery


It is simply not practical for most people to set up an ice bath. I've done cryotherapy a few times and enjoyed it, but it wasn't practical to make part of any routine. Outdoor cold exposure and cold showers are likely insufficient to achieve the recovery benefits.

Does it work? Probably, but I'm skeptical that it is a huge lever in recovery. If you've already dialed in your diet, sleep, and are getting older, and have the resources, then sure, go for it.

The debunkers for this category claim cold will kill your muscle gains. It takes about 5 minutes of research to learn that one should wait an hour after lifting before doing cold exposure. Problem solved.


### Fat Loss


Cold exposure is not magical for fat loss. There are some very popular health influencers making ridiculous claims on this point. Cold exposure builds brown fat. Brown fat burns a lot of calories. Therefore, cold exposure is helpful for fat loss, right? Nope. That only looks at the short term. Brown fat drives appetite.

My post [Temperature and Appetite](/2023/10/temperature-and-appetite/) goes into detail about why cold exposure is more likely to cause weight gain (in the long run) than fat loss. Heat is the lever for fat loss, not cold.

There are also fans of saunas who feel the need to attack the cold exposure fans. Both can be valuable tools—no need to pick a camp.


### Longevity via Lower Body Temperature


Bryan Johnson has shared his experience with using ice baths to lower his body temperature to 94°F. By reducing his body temperature, he believes that it will extend his lifespan. I think this stems from animal studies where rodents with lower body temperatures lived longer.

The oldest people tend to have lower body temperatures. There are several ways to think about this, and I don't know the answer. Did they live longer because they preserved their life by "running their battery" more efficiently, or is it that we aren't seeing the data from the people who didn't reach old age? Did the people who died earlier die with a lower or higher body temperature? If the slope is downward for all of us, does it make sense to force the slope downwards faster? Could forcing it lower result in having an infection take us out earlier in our senior years?

Rodents kept in labs would not have to deal with infections if they were free-living. They would need to mount a fever to fight off an illness. So naturally, their body could become more efficient. Is this what is happening?

My body temperature increased over the years. I don't know exactly why, but I suppose it was due to either [seed oil restriction or frequent blood donations](/2024/08/body-temps-on-severe-seed-oil-restriction-n1/).

FireInTheBottle has written about how body temperatures have dropped across society. This could be a good thing if it means we live in a cleaner environment with fewer pathogens. Alternatively, this could be a negative consequence if it drives down metabolic rates, thereby increasing the likelihood of obesity. Both could also be true.

I'm undecided on this point. The debunkers have challenged all the longevity claims, but that doesn't mean they are correct; it simply means the experiment is still ongoing and has a plausible explanation. We may not find out for a few decades, but we need to try to discover the answer.


### Resilience


I don't see much discussion on this point, but I think this is the best reason for cold exposure.

I think there is a longevity benefit that is not related to cold exposure. It was an idea from Art De Vany. We can use cold safely to induce stress on our body at a time of our choosing. Then we warm up. We train our body and mind to become more resilient. We survive these daily micro-stressors so that we don't go through life unchallenged.

If we can demonstrate resilience regularly, we will be better equipped to handle more serious health challenges later in life. Fasting, cold exposure, and exercise are three levers for resilience.

Fasting taught me to be okay with hunger, and a few years ago, when our water heater broke in the middle of winter for several days, I was fine taking ice-cold showers.

Although I'm unsure how this could be tested, having a resilient mindset, I'm certain, would provide a longevity benefit.

I don't do it regularly, but I enjoy it. Like sauna or exercise, it's one of those small stressors that make you feel good immediately after.

Unfortunately, like you say, it's just super impractical logistically if you don't have a yard or garage to put a permanent ice bath.

No cold showers for me.  My current gym is relatively high end and has a cold plunge at some locations.  It my location gets it I'll probably try it along with the saunas.

A gym I sometimes go to has a cold tub (~50degF).  After a resistance training workout I would typically sit in it for ~5 minutes before a few minutes in the hot tub followed by 10-15 minutes in the dry sauna.  I can't say that this routine has made any measurable difference in my health but I do feel I'm more tolerant of a wider range of ambient temperatures.  I also enjoyed it and felt very relaxed after all that.  I had no problem sitting in that cold tub other than my hands which I couldn't keep submerged for very long at all.  I was doing this a couple of times a week but I don't work close to that gym now so I get there much less often.
