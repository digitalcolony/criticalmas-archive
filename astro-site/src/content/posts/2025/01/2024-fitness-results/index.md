My [last fitness results](/2022/12/my-fitness-results-2022/) post was from 2022. I didn't do one last year, because I was recovering from my hernia surgery. Here is my 2024 health and fitness update:


### Diet and Weight


Another year has passed since 2019 and I am still locked in at 182 pounds. I've effortlessly kept off the 40 pounds I lost via various versions of the [Potato Diet/Potato Hack](https://potatohack.com) and [Potatoes and Protein](/2018/12/potatoes-and-protein-a-no-hunger-template-for-fat-loss/). Although I still eat a decent amount of cooked and cooled potatoes, my diet is mostly vegan plus some SMASH seafood and fat-free Greek yogurt. _\* SMASH stands for salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring._ In prior years, I would eat more clean meat in the winter and be more plant-based the rest of the year. Cycle between the two options to capture the benefits of each approach. Each year that meat window gets smaller. Now I feel best on a high-protein mostly whole food plant-based diet. Given the high levels of pollution in seafood, I stick to the SMASH options, but I also regularly donate blood to purge heavy metals and environmental toxins. There is no perfect answer, but this is working best for me now. I can explore this topic more in a separate post if there is interest. ![](./img/potato-viking.jpg)


### New Gym


My old small gym closed this year, and now I am at LA Fitness. Much bigger. More equipment plus a sauna. As much as I liked my old gym, I'm liking the new setup even more. I'm lifting and using the sauna on average 3 times a week. So far, the sauna han't [destroyed my skin](/2019/01/regular-sauna-use-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/) like it did years ago when I went every single day.


### Still No Cardio


Every year I post about how I didn't do enough cardio and that this will be the year that I turn it all around. Well, I won't make that promise again. I know the problem. I start something and then I get knee pain or hip pain or something else. Then I quit, get better, let months pass, and then start up again only to repeat the cycle. I need to tackle the root problem first. I need to build strength and balance equally in the core region. Hips, glutes, groin, abs, etc. Years of injuries have made my left side weaker than my right. When I try to jog or use an elliptical machine, this imbalance catches up with me quickly. Solving this problem will be a top priority in 2024. Until then, I won't repeat the cardio injury loop.


### Odds and Ends


My average daily steps were 9,922. So close to 10,000. I need to lock in a few more steps in the summer before the November rains arrive. I still stretch every morning and evening, but I avoid yoga moves where I twist with my abs stretched. I believe this triggered my right-side hernia, which I explained in my [I Got a Hernia](/2023/08/i-got-a-hernia/) post. I still do [shoulder hangs daily](/2023/06/perfect-posture-progress/). This could be the greatest 1-minute health hack ever. I hope I didn't miss anything.

By cardio I suppose you mean running/biking? Have you tried doing some lower zone "cardio" like walking or light hiking? That's much easier on my knees. Also less boring than running in a circle/on a treadmill, which is a major turn off for me..

I wonder if adding some weight ("rucking") but keeping the tempo slower for less impact, unlike running, would be better for joints and still give you more intensity. I've been eye with it myself, but haven't done it so far.

I hang everyday. Very good.

Here's a link to a scientific explanation of healing cartilage along with practical suggestions. I am just starting doing 10 minutes of light bike riding 3 times per day. https://youtu.be/6PNBjKJ9hxQ?si=r-IsKhx76q7IOpTz

@exfatloss - I like the idea of rucking and mentioned it in the 2022 post, however I need to fix the imbalance issue first. One side is weaker than the other. If I can get everything evenly strong then I can add in rucking or similar. 

@mark - I can do the light biking. I don't think cartilage is the issue, but it might be preventative.

Well done maintaining your weight for another year.‍♂️

I add bivalves, specifically mussels to  consumption of sardines and salmon for the healthiest part of my animal protein consumption (I suspect oats actually provide the healthiest part of my total protein consumption).

One handed farmer's carries are my favourite core exercises and might get your weak side up to fighting strength.

@seantheaussie - Good idea. I already do the 2-handed, but I can see how 1-handed would be helpful.

By the way I agree that the hang is great value.
