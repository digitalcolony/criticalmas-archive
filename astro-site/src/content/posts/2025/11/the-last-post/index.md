This is the final post on CriticalMAS.

I’ve received [some difficult news](https://michaelallensmith.substack.com/p/sad-news), which I’ve shared in more detail over on Substack. From now on, I’ll be using [Substack](https://michaelallensmith.substack.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michaelallensmith/) for any future updates or announcements.

As part of this transition, I’ve begun archiving the entire blog. My goal is to preserve it as a static resource for as long as possible. Comments are now closed to support that process.

Thank you for being part of this journey—whether you’ve been here since the early days or just stumbled in recently. Your readership, insights, and conversations have meant the world to me. It’s been a fun, thoughtful, and enriching ride.

See you on the next platform.
