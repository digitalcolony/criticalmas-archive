_For a background to this post see [How I Plan to Lose 20 Pounds and Win the Bet](/2014/02/plan-lose-20-pounds-win-bet/)._ Week #11 Weigh-In: **\-1**. Total Loss: \-9. These posts are getting boring. This will be the last regularly scheduled weekly weigh in. From here on out I will be updating a spreadsheet instead.

I like what Pauline said in [her comment](/2014/05/20-pound-bet-week-10-weigh/#comment-22832) on the Week 10 Weigh In.

>  I read two things recently regarding eating healthily – practise, practise, practise. And consistency as long as you keep trending in the right direction, you will get there.

Practice is essential for the individual, but it isn't a spectator sport. If I gather any new insight or reach my goal, I'll post again on the blog. Until then, I'll jot down numbers and notes in the shared spreadsheet.
