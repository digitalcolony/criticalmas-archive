For the longest time, I have rejected the idea of having a newsletter for this site. There are too many spammy sites out there that have jumped on the "win the inbox" meme. But there are some people doing it right. They cultivate content and limit the number of emails they send. And although I wish the world would all embrace [RSS](/2013/11/shutting-down-the-criticalmas-facebook-page/), I can see that isn't going to happen. Facebook, Twitter and Google+ want to get between content providers and content consumers. A newsletter is a way around that control. Unlike Matt Stone and Danny Roddy, I have zero plans to ever shut down my website and become newsletter only. They are both making a serious mistake, which I'll cover in a future post. My initial plans for the Critical MAS newsletter is to summarize what is new on the blog as well as highlight older posts that are still relevant. I don't see any reason to send the newsletter out more than 1 or 2 times a month. If I were still actively posting on finance, I could see a more frequent mailing, but I'm not.

If I am a lover of RSS, is there any reason to sign up for a newsletter? I don't do those other techie social media things...

@John - Using RSS you will already be aware of the new content. I will be highlighting some older content, all which is available on the site. If that is of value, then sign up, otherwise stick with RSS. At this time, I don't plan on developing unique content for the newsletter, but that might change in the future. If it does, I'll make that announcement on the blog before it happens.

The primary person I am trying to reach is the non-RSS user that forgets to check the site. When I shutdown the Facebook group for this page, several readers got out of the habit of reading posts here. A newsletter is a perfect solution for them.

Why  no more posts on Finance? Would love to read your take on cryptocurrencies.

New reader and just signed up for the newsletter. Please don't go into the direction of Matt and Danny!! I know you said, you weren't and I'm looking forward to reading your reason why. Is there a way to email you some questions?

Thanks!

Thanks! I swear I read your 'about me' at least twice. Must have missed the email or I didn't scroll down far enough :) I'll compile the email tomorrow or Monday....thanks again.
