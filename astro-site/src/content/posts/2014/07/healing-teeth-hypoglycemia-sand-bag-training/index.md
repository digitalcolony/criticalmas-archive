I've been adding books to my Kindle for a few months, but until I arrived in California I hadn't gotten around to reading most of them. This week I read three.


### #1 Healing Teeth


![How I Healed My Teeth Eating Sugar: A Guide to Improving Dental Health Naturally](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g8MQKpFbL.jpg) _How I Healed My Teeth Eating Sugar: A Guide to Improving Dental Health Naturally by Joey Lott_

My choppers are pretty awesome, but [do anything I can to avoid dentists](/2009/12/why-i-dislike-american-dentists-and-what-i-did-about-it/) so I am receptive to any message that we can restore our dental health through the nutritional choices we make. The title of this book is - by the author's own words - meant to grab your attention. It is not a protocol that uses sugar to fix cavities. But you can use sugar to boost metabolism, which could help the tooth heal. An indirect path.

The book gives a shout out to [Weston A. Price's work](/2011/01/nutrition-and-physical-degeneration/) connecting dental health with fat soluble vitamins (A, D, K). It is a quick read and you are likely to walk away with a few ideas on improving the health of your teeth. For me I was interested in the discussion of calcium bentonite clay as not only a supplement mix in drinks, but to brush onto the teeth themselves.


### #2 Hypoglycemia


![Hypoglycemia: What It Is, What It Isn't, and How to Fix the Root Problem](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CC9Tq5KXL.jpg)

_Hypoglycemia: What It Is, What It Isn't, and How to Fix the Root Problem by Matt Stone_

Even though I've never considered myself hypoglycemic, I gave this a read because I've gotten value from other books by Matt Stone. The beginning of the book leads off with a discussion of hypoglycemia and how our current thinking about it is flawed. The book also talks about why we can sometimes get tired after a meal, especially breakfast. All this ties into more discussion of metabolism and body temperature, which are topics well covered in his books Eat For Heat and [Diet Recovery 2](/2013/03/diet-recovery-2-and-the-turn-up-the-heat-experiment/).


### #3 Sandbag Training


![Sandbag Training Bible: Functional Workouts to Tone, Sculpt and Strengthen Your Entire Body](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610LubuIltL.jpg) _Sandbag Training Bible: Functional Workouts to Tone, Sculpt and Strengthen Your Entire Body by Ben Hirshberg_

I read about sandbag training a decade ago in the context of [grip strength training](/2009/10/weight-lifting-wisdom-for-the-tall-lanky-guy/). I'm sure it was mentioned in one of John Brookfield's books. But I hadn't looked into actual sandbag training until I read this book. At first I thought I wouldn't like this book, mostly because I dislike most fitness books, as they preach high skill movements when a simple plan such as [Hillfit 2.0](/2013/07/hillfit-2-0-a-zero-budget-approach-to-high-intensity-training/) is safer and more effective.

This book won me over, because the author keeps it simple. He shows you how to make your own sandbag and then walks you through a variety of workout philosophies using the sandbag. One section is devoted to High Intensity Training. Good! Now I wouldn't do all the exercises in the book, but he has done a decent job of selecting movements that are not too difficult to learn. There are no stupid exercises, such as [jumping on a pile of boxes](/2012/02/you-are-your-own-gym/).

I don't think I'll start sandbag training, but I could see a younger version of me really getting into this, especially when I had my own backyard.
