I am taking off for a week to Seattle and Portland, so I probably won't be posting anything new until mid next week. I'll be at [Coffee Fest](http://www.coffeefest.com/) drinking massive amounts of espresso. Say hi if you see me.

I created two new BEST OF pages for the site.

1.  [Back Pain](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/back-pain/)
2.  [Quantified Self](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/quantified-self/) 

Each page is a collection of what I consider the best posts on those topics. I also reorganized [Fitness Insights](https://criticalmas.org/best-of/fitness-insights/), so the more important articles are now higher on the page.
