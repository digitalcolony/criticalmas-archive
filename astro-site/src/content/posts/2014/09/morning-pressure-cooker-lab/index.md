Yesterday I raved about my latest hobby which the [pressure cooker](/2014/09/pressure-cooker-game-changer/). This morning I decided to attempt a Vietnamese style chicken congee. I love this dish. Chicken, rice, broth, Thai basil, ginger and of course fish sauce. The perfect breakfast food. A million times better than oatmeal.

It came out very good, but I think I can make it better. Give me a week and I'll have a recipe that will amaze and delight. :)

How do you do with carbs like this in the morning?  I live in Hong Kong, so congee is an ever-present option for breakfast, but I usually go with a butter coffee or protein and fat oriented breakfast.  I feel like this would leave me hungry and low energy about 10am, but haven't experimented yet.  Any experience you can share would be instructive.  Thanks!

@Brock - I do great with carbs in the AM and the PM. 

The only food I avoid in the morning now is bacon. I feel drugged like tired when I eat bacon, so I will only have it in the evening.
