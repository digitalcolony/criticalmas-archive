Hi MAS,
Novice coffee maker question.
My favorite brewing method is the french press, because I like the flavor of the oils from the beans.  I don't like having to empty the grounds into the sink, however, so I end up using the AeroPress, which cleans up nicely with extraction of the coffee grounds "puck."  Do yo know of a method that retains the oils, but is relatively un-messy? Maybe a large-pore filter method?  
Thanks.

@Jim - Yes. I was a daily French Press drinker for almost a decade. Then I switched to the Clever. All the richness of FP, but none of the grit. Easy cleanup..

From the day I started using a Clever, I stopped using my FP. Eventually I gave my FP away.

MAS - What are your feelings on coffee from the Aeropress vs. the Clever?  I bought an Aeropress and no complaints but I prefer coffee from my French Press.  I've got my coffee dialed-in the way I like it using the FP but maybe I need to tweak my Aeropress process in terms of grind, temp, amount, etc.

@EJ - I like both the AeroPress and Clever better than the French Press. And I drank French Press exclusively for a decade. The Clever is more similar to French Press, but IMO is superior as it solves the grit problem. 

Also, as the temperature of coffee drops, I find that the AeroPress tastes much better than all other brewing methods. I can't drink French Press coffee once it cools.

MAS
The minipresso looks like a fun device.  Not a plug--just looked interesting.
