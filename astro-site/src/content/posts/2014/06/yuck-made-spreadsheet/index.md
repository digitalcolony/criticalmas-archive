In December 2012, I received the book Yuck! The Things People Eat. At the time I said:

> This is more than a book. It is an eating challenge wish list.

![Yuck! The Things People Eat](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oBRDCPpeL.jpg) _Yuck! The Things People Eat by Neil Setchfield_ I've been meaning to convert the book into a spreadsheet. One that I can track my progress and one that others can download for themselves. It is ready.

Although some foods will be more of a challenge than others, I think I could eat them all with one exception. There is no way I could eat a dog. Rat sure. Snakes - may be a small bite. But no way would I eat a dog. Even looking at the photo is disturbing. I think I've had blood sausage and monkfish roe, but I can't say for certain, so I won't count them. And I've had sheep and ox testicles, but not goat, so I left that unchecked as well. So I've consumed 20 foods out of 123 Yuck! foods (or 16.23%). How about you? UPDATE: Recalled the post where I ate an octopus. Up to 20.

Only 14 for me - taking the list liberally (does head cheese count as "pig's face"?)  I've got some catching up to do.
