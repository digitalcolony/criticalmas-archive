Recently I went to a local Mexican place and instead of getting my normal tacos, I tried the posole soup. I never had it before. It was great, so I went home and made my own. I figured it would be hard to replicate the flavor, but it was very easy. Posole soup is made using cubed pork, hominy, peppers, garlic, and onions in a broth covered with cilantro. That's it. I used beef stock, but I suspect even water would work well. Cook the veggies, brown the meat, throw into liquid, add hominy, cook for 15 minutes, serve, and top with cilantro. If you need more details look at [Posole Recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20221209194505/https://www.reluctantgourmet.com/posole-recipe/) on The Reluctant Gourmet. ![posole](./img/posole.jpg) ![hominey](./img/hominey.jpg) ![posole-finished](./img/posole-finished.jpg)
