Ready for a super easy Korean soup recipe. Here it is.

1.  Heat water.
2.  Add chopped kimchi.
3.  Add sliced or cubed SPAM.
4.  Serve when warm. I heated mine for 10 minutes.

You can also throw in any cooked rice if you like. Super easy, super fast and tasty. ![kimchi-spam-soup](./img/kimchi-spam-soup.jpg) I didn't measure anything. Old kimchi would be better than fresher, but all should work. In the event you need to dial up the heat more, you can add some [gochujang](/2012/10/making-gluten-free-korean-chili-paste-gochujang/) or sriracha sauce. Add fish sauce if more salt is needed. And if you run out of kimchi, top the served soup with chopped scallions.

I don't remember if I've ever eaten spam.

Anyway, try adding a spoon of miso or soy sauce to your kimchi pots.

Reminds of which, have you tried Kimchi-jjigae? Easy to make too.
