Week #3 Weigh-in: **\-1**. Total loss: **\-4**.

This was an odd week. One of my competitors left a big bag of sliced salami in my refrigerator and I was tempted. I ate more than I should have earlier in the week. Sneaky! That same competitor created a fitness blog called MAS BETTER. Too funny! Starting today I have created a rule against eating processed meats as the calories add up super fast. My weigh-in this week was taken on Friday morning, as I knew I would be donating blood later that day. After donating blood, I load up on salty food and water, so those scale readings are likely to be flawed.

Thursday was a rough day. Poor sleep the night before and I was feeling cold. Also, an important event I was excited to attend was canceled last minute. So I ate an entire Lindt chocolate bar. Here is the food journal for Week #3.

Notes:

1.  Going into Week #4, I need to focus more on creating a caloric deficit on weekdays. Weekends are more challenging.
2.  I'm questioning the effect apples or fruit in general have on appetite. This seems to be a highly debated topic. Some - especially those that follow Ray Peat - believe fruit is slimming. Others believe the opposite. I'm not sure who is correct or if there is context as to who does better on which source of carbs when it comes to dieting. If you have any thoughts on this, please leave a comment.

MAS,
The MAS Better blog looks pretty good.  :-)

Swimmer's nose clips while you eat.  Break the connection to the food aroma and appetite will decrease.

MAS - Maybe it's just me, but I don't see an increase in salty foods on Friday and Saturday.  Truth be told, the week looks like a rather salty one in general, not just the salami.  How salty are the Korean and Vietnamese dishes you are eating?

As for your question about fruit, I'm not sure I understand the concern. To me, whether fruit is "slimming" is a <i>relative</i> question - "Is fruit slimming compared to X?"  So what is your "X," the alternative(s) to which you are comparing fruit?  Not eating at all?  Cucumber? Twinkies? Knowing that may provide the context that makes a difference.

@David  - I may do that soon if the fat loss stalls.

@Geoff - I added a lot of salt plus I was mixing salt into water and drinking. The Viet dishes have a healthy dose of fish sauce. The Korean dishes don;t have the higher salt.

As for the fruit concern. It is a question of fructose vs glucose Which is best for fat loss? Or is the question more complicated? Some people state starches will cause weight gain, but others point to the high satiety of potatoes. I'm wondering what role fruit is having on my appetite. I do recall when I dropped weight in 2008-2010 that I ate almost no fruit, but I was trying so many things back then, so there is no way to know if that had any effect.
