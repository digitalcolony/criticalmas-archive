2.  As the days get warmer and longer I think AM fasting will get easier.

You might cut the bananas and the processed lunch meat as well as the cheese.

I discovered YourEatopia.com this week via Matt Stone's forums, and am now wondering why you are trying to lose weight in the first place. (This is what happens when you find a new blog. :-) )

In my own case, when I switched from meat/junk food to meat/vegetables/legumes this week, I became exhausted and achy, which it turns out is normal for someone finally eating well enough to heal. I assume that's not been an issue for you, since you never lost that much weight or ate badly to begin with.

At any rate, I now find your experiment bizarre but look forward to comparing results in four-five months regardless.

You should throw in some Shangri-la diet principals - some tasteless calories with an hour of fasting before and after. I always found it useful.

@Anemone - Here is why. https://criticalmas.org/2014/02/regained-weight-lost/

@Russell - Maybe, but in the past I hadn't needed those tricks, especially in the AM.

Plateaus are normal on the way down its a bit of a zig zag ride.  I am always amazed how the body stabilised at a certain weight, a few weeks up and down and then settles at lower weight.  Its like appetite, digestion and the brain all synchronise over time.

MAS - These journals are very informative.  Thanks for posting this part of your weight loss journey for us.  If I were you I'd resist the urge to change anything just yet.  A one-week plateau is nothing too concerning and could be the result of any number of variables. I'd leave things "as is" for at least another week before changing anything.

@Pauline - Good point. A friend of mine reminded me that to look my progress as 2 weeks of a 1.5# weight loss, instead of 3# and 0#. 

@Geoff - I agree. It is far too soon to start mixing things up. I will practice pushing back the cheese to late in the day to curb PM hunger.

I eat way less and can't lose that last 10-15lbs.  In fact today all I've had is coffee + 6 pieces of tuna sushi for lunch + 1/2 avocado w/cheese for dinner.  Drank diluted lemonade otherwise.  I have what is known as skinnyfat so trying to bulk up makes me fat and losing weight affects my musculature but not my midsection.  

btw:  do you wear a hairpiece?  Looks like a good one.

@thomas - No hairpiece. My hair is thick and glorious!

I also see maintenance as very valuable so not to be discounted.

What do you think of Tim ferriss' idea of eating dirty one day a week.  I have hit a weight loss plateau and have considered eating whatever I want like he said to do once a week but am skeptical that it actually "kick starts" weight loss.  From my research it seems if you are a skinnyfat ectomorph the best route is to get skinny first and build up muscle slowly.  Bulking just turns straight to fat and I can't get rid of these love handles.  They are small but creep up my back.  

OK about the hairpiece...err...sorry I mean glorious head of hair, our little secret ;)

@thomas - I like the cheat day idea. Tim Ferriss designed a diet not for optimal results but for optimal compliance, which I think is a brilliant way to approach fat loss.

@Sheri - Long time reader!  

Sheri has been reading since August 2001 when I got my mug in the USA Today.  :)

I also need to lose 20lbs from my midsection, so you do believe that overeating will catalyze weight loss? or do you think it is more of a psychological crutch/reward?  I just can't seem to lose the bellyfat and don't think cheat days make sense.

### MAS

@thomas - The Ferriss diet is about going 6 days undereating and 1 day overeating. The logic is the net result over a full week is a calorie deficit and fat loss. It is one approach. Works for some and not for others.
