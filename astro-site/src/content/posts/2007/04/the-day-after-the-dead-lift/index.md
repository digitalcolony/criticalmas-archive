I'm slowly recovering from [my accident](/2007/04/no-more-morning-dead-lifts/) from yesterday. Last night the pain became unbearable and I couldn't get back to bed, so I slept the remainder of the night in my Lazy-Boy recliner.

Shortly after noon I had recovered enough that I was able to baby-step walk without holding onto the walls. On a typical day, I have enough flexibility to put my palms on the floor without bending my knees. Today I can't even reach my knees.

> My husband sprained his back a few years ago. We found MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) to be extremely helpful. This is basically the same form of dietary sulfur which is found in plants. Connective tissues need sulfur to heal. It also seems to have analgesic effects (for my husband, and anecdotally reported by others) although I have not read any chemical explanation for that. You can get MSM at a health food store or probably Whole Foods; it is less expensive that glucosamine / chondroitin. I believe you could take 3g/day or so while the pain is bad, maybe dropping to 1g/day. Best of luck and wishes for a quick recovery.
