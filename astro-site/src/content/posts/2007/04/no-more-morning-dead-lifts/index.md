I completely threw out my back today after doing a warm-up set of dead-lifts at the gym. After 3 hours and 3 Vicodin, I still can't move. This is the worst pain I've ever experienced. No more morning dead-lifts or squats. I promise. I've learned my lesson for real this time. When it comes to leg strength, I'll stick to hiking up mountains. I promise.
