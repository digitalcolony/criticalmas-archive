I grew up listening to pop music from the 1980s. Then around 1995 I found a radio station in Tampa Bay that played nothing but music from the 1970s (107.3 The Coast). At first I only liked the classic rock and disco music from that era. But slowly overtime, I came to love 70s pop more than 80s pop.

A few years ago I constructed my ultimate 70s pop 2-disc mix. This mix has no classic rock, disco or funk. That would be too easy. Instead I constructed 2 distinct categories for 70s pop: Polyester and Cheese. Polyester is that smug 70s sound that reeks of shag carpet and wood panels. It's the _serious_ side of pop, which now sounds so wonderfully ridiculous. Cheese is the sugary pop or _fun_ side of pop. Think roller skates and bubble gum.

Enough background. Here is the greatest 70s pop mix ever. I give you Polyester and Cheese.
