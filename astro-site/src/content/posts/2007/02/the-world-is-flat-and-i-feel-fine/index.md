Just finished reading an outstanding book called _The World is Flat - A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century (expanded 2006 version)_ by Thomas Friedman. As a web developer that came of age at the dawn of the web, I was impressed with how well he researched the effect technology has had on _flattening_ the world in the last 10 years. ![The World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JGBJ6DVwL.jpg) _The World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century by Thomas L. Friedman_ Friedman breaks economic globalization into three eras:

-   Globalization 1.0 (1492-1800) - Countries went global
-   Globalization 2.0 (1800-2000) - Companies went global
-   Globalization 3.0 (2000-now) - Individuals _went_ global

We are now in an era where individuals no longer need their country or company to collaborate with individuals around the world. Just this weekend I was working on code with a fellow programmer in Bangalore, India. This kind of collaboration at the individual level was almost non-existent just a few years ago. This book also covers topics such as free trade and outsourcing. It even gave me insight and ideas that I will use to guide my career in technology. If you push pixels for a living, you need to read this book.
