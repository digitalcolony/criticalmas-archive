On a whim I decided to get my haircut exactly like the guy beside me at the barbershop. He was a Marine officer and had a _high and tight_. My hair hasn't been that short since Army [basic training 1987](/2008/04/military-mas/).

Then I noticed something interesting. People started acting more polite to me. Everyone started calling me sir and holding doors open for me. My guess is they thought I was a returning war hero. I'm not going to correct them.

I don't think Clinton would refer to me as _[man](/2006/09/the-presidential-motorcade/)_ today.

Hah that is somewhat funny. It is a little bit annoying at the same time.

Yeah my never got to your length but it stayed between 5-8in for the last 5 years. I thinkin of basically doin what you did today. Not sure why. Hmm. Guess I am getting tired of the hippy references...??? hah

my hair's a little longer that yours was in the picture w/clinton, but i have to cut it short.  i start work for a private security firm tomorrow and the guy that runs it is a fomer marine.  he told me to go to his barber before work and tell him i need a high and tight.  I wasn't sure what that was -- so i started googling.  i'm bringing your picture with me cause your hair looks a hellov a lot better than most of the high and tight pictures i found.  if i didn't need the j.o.b. so bad i'd never be doing this.  every girl i ever met tells me what nice hair i got.  oh well guess i'm gonna have to find another way to attract the girls.

I like that too. You may not know that I was in the reserves for 12 years. I'm use to the short haired man
