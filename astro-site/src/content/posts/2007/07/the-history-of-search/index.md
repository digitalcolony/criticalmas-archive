I just finished reading a great book called _The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture by John Battelle._

It covers the history of the search engine and focuses mostly on Google. If that sounds boring, it isn't. At its core, this is a business book that goes into detail on market assumptions about search and what happened when those assumptions changed.
