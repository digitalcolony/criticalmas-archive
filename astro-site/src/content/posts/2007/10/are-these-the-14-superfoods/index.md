I just finished reading an outstanding nutrition book on what are considered the _best_ foods you can eat. Back in college I read a lot of nutrition books and built a diet framework with that information. Not surprisingly many of my staples have earned _SuperFood_ status. ![SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IclWonAvL._SL500_.jpg) _SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life by Steven G. Prat_t lists the following foods as _SuperFoods_: 1-Beans 2-Blueberries 3-Broccoli 4-Oats 5-Oranges 6-Pumpkin 7-Wild Salmon 8-Soy 9-Spinach 10-Tea 11-Tomatoes 12-Turkey 13-Walnuts 14-Yogurt Of the 14, I eat all but oranges and turkey. Why don't I eat oranges? I'll save that tale for [another post](/2007/10/why-i-dont-like-oranges/). The food the author made the strongest case for is not even listed as a _SuperFood_. That food is the orange bell pepper. It is nutritionally far superior to oranges. He made a weak case for consuming soy. So weak in fact, I will probably reduce my intake as it is estrogenic. Judging from the photo of the good doctor on the back cover, he can probably run a fast 10K, but I doubt he could bench press his weight. Despite the weak case for soy, the book is an excellent reference. I took notes and carried them with me to the grocery store yesterday. UPDATE 2024: I no longer have concerns regarding soy. **Legacy Comments** Derek

> I read this one a short while back as well. Pretty dry stuff I thought but still informative and solid. I eat all of this stuff regularly except for the salmon which I dislike. Pumpkin is hard to eat except as a pie...made a pumpkin smoothie and it wasn't bad...like drinking pumpkin pudding through a straw. Trader Joe's sells awesome dried wild blueberries that are great in your daily cereal, fyi.

> The author lists carrots, sweet potatoes and orange bell peppers as alternatives to pumpkin. Those are probably more practical foods than pumpkin.
