I'm slowly getting caught up on all my book reviews from the past two months. Here are three more reviews. Each of these books were very short.

One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer was a book I stumbled on while looking for something else. It was a nice find. Kaizen is a Japanese term for _continual improvement_.

Continual small steps are the core to Kaizen and each chapter is broken down into an application of that philosophy. The chapter _Take Small Actions_ advises us to _"take steps so small they seem trivial or even laughable"_ and the result is _"you'll sail past obstacles that defeated you before."_

Because I liked the One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way, Amazon recommended I read a short fable about a monk.

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: A Fable About Fulfilling Your Dreams & Reaching Your Destiny by Robin Sharma was a type of book that I never read, but I'm glad I did. It was a story follow-up to some of the concepts in the Kaizen book. Although the book was a little too _new age_ in parts, it did have some words of wisdom.

The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick) by Seth Godin is a book you should read if you are considering quitting something. It helps you figure out when to dig deep and power on and when to change focus and move on to something else.
