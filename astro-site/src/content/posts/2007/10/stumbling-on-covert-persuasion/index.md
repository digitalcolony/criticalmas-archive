Since I started my TV-free experiment, I've been reading more books than usual.

![Stumbling on Happiness](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416ie48vq-L.jpg) Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert surprised me. I first saw the author on the Colbert Report and thought his book sounded stupid. Later I talked to an old co-worker that was enjoying the book, so I put it on my list to read. I'm so glad I did. This is one of the best books I have ever read (actually I listened to the audio version).

This is not a pump-yourself-up get happy positive-thinking self-help book. It's more like a user guide to human emotion. Predictions of the future and our recollection of the past are often flawed. The things we imagine will make us happy often don't and things we didn't imagine making us happy often do. The author has a good sense of humor as he takes you through psychology studies explaining human emotion.

At the end of the book, _Stumbling On Happiness_ jumps from why the human mind is hardwired to guess wrong to two powerful _replicator_ ideas held by society that are false. If I haven't convinced you to get this book, check out the [Stumbling on Happiness interview](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/03/stumbling-happiness/) by Jonathan Stein.

![Covert Persuasion: Psychological Tactics and Tricks to Win the Game](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Hg0zCRQXL.jpg) Covert Persuasion: Psychological Tactics and Tricks to Win the Game by Kevin Hogan is the flip-side of _Stumbling on Happiness_. Hogan's audience is primarily salespeople. It uses many failings of human emotion to land a sale. Earlier this year, I read Hogan's other book _The Science of Influence: How to Get Anyone to Say "Yes" in 8 Minutes or Less!_ Many of the pages of that book were lifted and placed directly into _Covert Persuasion_. _Covert Persuasion_ is basically an updated version of _The Science of Influence_.

Some of the tactics can border on sneaky or unethical if used _for evil_. The book lists 55 distinct _Covert Persuasion_ tactics as well as a section devoted to _Hypnotic Language Patterns_. Trying to date that hot girl in accounting? You could go to the gym, but that's so 20th century. Try some _Covert Persuasion_ instead.

You can also use the information to detect when someone is trying to _covertly_ persuade you. It's almost like a vaccination shot against salespeople. Keep the book around and review it whenever you need a _booster_.

> Stumbling on Happiness was absolutely fascinating! It's so interesting that it's one of those books I'm planning to re-read again. Anyway, it's good to be reminded just how flawed our perception/prediction and subsequent decisions really can be.
