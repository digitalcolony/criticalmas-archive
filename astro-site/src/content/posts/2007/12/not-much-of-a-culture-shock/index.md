After reading the Culture Shock! books for [Chile](/2007/10/culture-shock-chile/) and Cuba, I thought I'd read the one for Vancouver. My first trip to Canada is in a week. How _shocking_ is the Vancouver culture? Judging solely by the book Culture Shock! Vancouver: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette (Culture Shock! at Your Door) by Cuek-Cheng Pang, not much. As I read this book I kept thinking that this couldn't possibly be written for an American audience. In fact, this couldn't have been written for any English speaking audience. Why was there a paragraph explaining how daylight savings works? There was even a page explaining how it is important to respond to wedding invites in a timely manner. Shocking! The Osmonds taught me an important lesson. _One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl._ The Culture Shock series is excellent and I will read more in the series, however, the Vancouver book is a waste of paper.
