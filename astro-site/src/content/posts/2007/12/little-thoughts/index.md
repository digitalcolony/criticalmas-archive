It seems most of the books I read these days at one point were mentioned in the Wall Street Journal. Yes I prefer non-fiction over fiction. And if the book has a finance or psychology angle, even better. With that said, I decided to read a fiction book before the year ended.

![Mezzanine](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RtX2ep54L.jpg) Mezzanine by Nicholson Baker is not an interesting story, but it was an interesting read. The book examines the thoughts of one man as he approaches and rides an escalator. That is the entire book. Every random thought becomes its own story until eventually, the main character reaches the top of the escalator.
