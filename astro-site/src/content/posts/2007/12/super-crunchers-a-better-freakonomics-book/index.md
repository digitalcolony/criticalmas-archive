After reviewing [Freakonomics](/2007/10/finally-read-freakonomics/) last October, Derek tipped me to another book in that genre that I might enjoy. ![Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-by-Numbers Is the New Way to Be Smart](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qy80LU6lL.jpg) _Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-by-Numbers Is the New Way to Be Smart by Ian Ayres_ was a better book than _Freakonomics_ in my opinion. _Super Crunchers_ was less about the answer derived from data analysis, it was more about constructing the question. This to me was more interesting. Having read this after [The Black Swan](/2007/12/the-black-swan/) was fortunate for me. In that book the lesson was we as humans are horrific at making predictions, because of various fallacies and biases. _Super Crunchers_ goes into how vastly expanding the data set and asking the right questions can produce better predictions than making professional judgments on any one piece of data. **Legacy Comments** Derek
