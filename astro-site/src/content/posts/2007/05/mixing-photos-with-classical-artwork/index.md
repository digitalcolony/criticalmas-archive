Today I was having some fun in Photoshop. Take the colors from a classical painting and apply them to a photograph. Below is an autumn photograph from New England, a Monet painting and the resulting mashup. [![](./img/ps-mashup-autumn-org-200.jpg "ps-mashup-autumn-org-200")](./img/ps-mashup-autumn-org-200.jpg)  [![](./img/ps-mashup-monet-org-200.jpg "ps-mashup-monet-org-200")](./img/ps-mashup-monet-org-200.jpg) [![](./img/ps-mashup-autumn-monet.jpg "ps-mashup-autumn-monet")](./img/ps-mashup-autumn-monet.jpg) Using Photoshop CS it is a very easy process. Load the painting and your photograph. Put your photo in focus and then select _Image … Adjustments … Match Color_ from the toolbar. From the _Source_ dropdown, select the painting and click OK. That’s it. You’re finished.


### Montevideo, Uruguay Meets Renoir


The first photo is a building I photographed in Montevideo last summer. The second is a classic Renoir painting. And the third is the Photoshop mashup of the two. ![ps-mashup-mv-org-200](./img/ps-mashup-mv-org-200.jpg)   ![ps-mashup-renoir200](./img/ps-mashup-renoir200.jpg) ![ps-mashup-mv-renoir-600](./img/ps-mashup-mv-renoir-600.jpg)


### Buenos Aires Meets Matisse


After leaving Uruguay, I went to Argentina and took the first photo. The second image is a Matisse painting. And the third is their hybrid. ![ps-mashup-ba3-org-200](./img/ps-mashup-ba3-org-200.jpg)  ![ps-mashup-matisse200](./img/ps-mashup-matisse200.jpg) ![ps-mashup-ba3-matisse](./img/ps-mashup-ba3-matisse.jpg)
