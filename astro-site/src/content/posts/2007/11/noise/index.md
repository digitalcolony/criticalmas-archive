Earlier this year I bought the book _Noise_. I tried to read it a few times while living in downtown San Diego. Whenever I started I would inevitably hear a car alarm or motorcycle. Outside noise was keeping me from reading the book _Noise_. Now that I'm back in the quiet comfort of the suburbs, I was finally able to read this book in peace.

![Noise](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z4CGG8N2L.jpg) Noise by Bart Kosko was not the book I was hoping for. I was hoping the book would provide a layperson's understanding of the strategies for reducing noise in society. It was mostly history and engineering formulas. The book had no practical applications. _How do you make a car quieter? How about a leaf blower? Urban planning to minimize noise?_

The one thing I adored about this book was the author wrote it without using a single comma. We've become a comma-crazed culture. In a _Wired_ interview, the author equated commas to _channel noise_. I wish I could have written that last sentence without using a comma.
