Two years ago I posted a recipe for [Beef Heart Stew](/2011/04/beef-heart-stew/). Although it was better than my beef heart curry attempt, it was just “_offal good_“, not “_awfully good_“. So I revisited this recipe and came up with something far better. This time I added some potatoes and red wine. I also removed the Thai peppers, added cumin and extended the cooking time.

**Summary**: _A rich stew made from beef heart using a slow cooker._

#### Ingredients


-   One beef heart cut into smaller bite sized pieces
-   2-3 carrots
-   1 onion
-   2-3 small red potatoes (or substitute)
-   3 garlic cloves
-   1-1.5 quarts of [beef stock or broth](/2011/04/homemade-beef-broth/)
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   pepper to taste
-   2 teaspoons thyme
-   1 Tablespoon of ground cumin
-   1/2 cup red wine


#### Instructions


1.  Cut up the onion and caramelize in pan with your favorite fat. I used tallow. Add to slow cooker.
2.  Cut up carrots and potatoes and put into slow cooker.
3.  Dice garlic and add to slow cooker.
4.  Cut up beef heart and add to slow cooker. Details [here](/2011/04/beef-heart-stew/).
5.  Add spices.
6.  Top off with beef stock and red wine.
7.  Cook on low for 8 hours. I like to cook the first hour on high.

Because of the 8 hour cooking time, start this one early. I no longer believe 5 hours is enough time.

Thanks for the recipe inspiration.

I think that beef hearts are a super-tasty introduction to organ meats for people who don't necessarily like the characteristic taste of liver.

Picking up my calves's hearts later on... (+ kidneys, liver, tongue) :)
